THE MOTOR RANGERS ON BLUE WATER
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE WATCHER OF THE TRAIL.
</h3>

<p>
A party of horsemen, riding in single file, was
making its way down the steep, rugged trail
leading from the interior to Santa Inez.  Although
they had not as yet glimpsed the little mission
town, which was their destination, the blue,
sparkling glint of the Pacific had, for some time,
been visible through the columnar trunks and
dark foliage of the red woods.
</p>

<p>
The four persons composing the little cavalcade
seemed to be in the best of spirits as their
sure-footed cayuses ambled along.  Their voices rose
high amid the hush of the densely wooded slopes.
Squirrels, blue-jays, and other denizens of the
Coast Range, fled incontinently as they heard the
high, boyish tones intruding into their domains.
</p>

<p>
But they need not have been afraid.  Fond as
the Motor Rangers, all three, were of exercising
their "twenty-twos" on any "small deer" that
came in sight, their minds, just then, were far too
much occupied to think of hunting.
</p>

<p>
"See the boat yet, Nat?" inquired Joe Hartley,
a stalwart, sun-bronzed lad of about seventeen.
He addressed a boy of about his own age, who
rode slightly in advance of the rest.  Like Joe,
Nat Trevor was attired in typical mountaineer's
costume, set off by a jaunty sombrero with a
leather band round the crown.
</p>

<p>
Nat turned in his saddle.
</p>

<p>
"I could hardly sight her yet, Joe," he
rejoined.  "But she'll be there on time.  Captain
Akers would not disappoint me, I know."
</p>

<p>
"Y-y-y-y-you've go-go-got acres of f-f-f-faith
in him, so to speak," came from the third young
rider in line, Ding-dong&mdash;otherwise William,&mdash;Bell,
of course.
</p>

<p>
Nat shook his quirt at the stuttering lad with
mock anger.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't stop your everlasting punning,
Ding-dong, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Have ter leave him behind.  I reckon that
would be the worst punishment for him," struck
in a loosely built, bronzed man, who rode behind
Ding-dong and sat his horse with the easy
grace of the practised rider.  His leather
"chaps," blue shirt, and red handkerchief,
carelessly knotted about his sun-burned throat, also
proclaimed him a typical westerner of the
Sierran region.  And so he was, for most of our
readers will by this time have recognized in him
Cal Gifford, the former driver of the Lariat
stage, who had so materially aided our young
Motor Rangers in their adventures in the wild
region which now lay behind them.  All of these
stirring incidents were related in a previous
volume of this series, "The Motor Rangers Through
the Sierras."
</p>

<p>
By a hair rope, which was "half-hitched"
round the horn of his saddle, Cal led an
exceedingly small burro, with sagely flapping ears.
The animal bore a big canvas pack, which,
besides containing the provisions of the party on
their dash from the mountains to the coast,
carried also the object of their expedition&mdash;namely,
the box of sapphires found in the dead miner's&mdash;Elias
Gooddale's&mdash;cabin.
</p>

<p>
On the return of the boys to Big Oak Flat
from their Sierran excursion they had found
themselves facing the problem of the safe
conveyance of the precious stones to a community
of law and order where they might be placed in
the proper hands till Elias Gooddale's heirs could
be found.
</p>

<p>
But, as will be recalled by the readers of "The
Motor Rangers Through the Sierras," Colonel
Morello's band was still at large, and it had been
decided that as the outlaws already knew of the
existence of the sapphires, and the identity of
their custodians, that it would be dangerous to
attempt to transport such a valuable freightage
through the lonely mountains by automobile.
</p>

<p>
The car, therefore, had been left in charge of
Herr Muller to take through to Santa Barbara.
The boys, for their part, adopted with all
enthusiasm Nat's plan, which was to tell Captain
Akers to bring Nat's motor boat "Nomad" from
Santa Barbara and meet them on the coast at
Santa Inez, an old mission town with a passable
harbor.  It was agreed that transportation of
the sapphires in this way would offer few
difficulties and no dangers, and as Herr Muller
politely but firmly declined to go a-cruising, the
boys were relieved of the task of finding some one
to take their fine touring car through to their
home town.
</p>

<p>
As for the "Nomad," she was a sixty-foot
cruising motor boat of thirty horse-power.  Nat
and his chums had seen her keel laid before they
set out for the Sierran trip, and when the question
of moving the sapphires came up, as has been
said, Nat at once hit on the idea of combining
business and pleasure by sending word to her
builder, Captain Akers, to bring her up to Santa
Inez.  Thus they would experience the delights
of a trial trip and at the same time feel that the
sapphires were safe and sound.
</p>

<p>
Lest it be wondered at that a lad of Nat's
age could own such a fine craft, we must refer
our new readers to the first volume of this
series, "The Motor Rangers' Lost Mine."  In this
book it was told how Nat and his chums routed
some rascals in Lower California, and how Nat
came into his own.  Inasmuch as his chums had
also, by his generosity, been made sharers in his
good fortune, none of the boys was short of
pocket money.  In fact, had they not all three
been steady-going, well-balanced lads it might
have been said they had too much.
</p>

<p>
But the Motor Rangers, instead of expending
their money foolishly, preferred to lay it out in
healthy, exciting expeditions, and that they had
already been recompensed by a goodly share of
adventures we know.  Possibly a word further
in relation to the sapphires they were
transporting may not be amiss.
</p>

<p>
The gems, then&mdash;which were all in the rough&mdash;had
been found by Nat and his chums in what
had at first appeared an abandoned hut in the
Sierras.  On investigating the place, however,
they discovered the body of the former occupant
of the hut, a miner named Elias Gooddale.  He
had evidently succumbed to the rigors of the
preceding Sierran winter.  Although everything else
in the hut had been pretty well devoured by
mountain rats, a tin despatch box had escaped
mutilation.  Opening this the lads found papers
therein, telling of the hiding place of some sapphires
under the hearthstone.  Gooddale, with a dying
effort, had also penned a will, leaving the gems
to his unnamed next of kin.  It was recalled by
Cal Gifford that Gooddale had come to the
community some years before and had engaged on a
quest for sapphires.  He was adjudged crazy by
the other miners, but he kept steadily on his
strange hunt.  Judging by the boys' find, it
appeared that death must have overtaken him in
the very moment of victory.
</p>

<p>
However that may have been, it so happened
that while the party was examining its strange
find a face appeared at the window.  It was the
countenance of Ed. Dayton, one of Col. Morello's
principal lieutenants.  The boys had had
trouble with him in Lower California&mdash;as related
in "The Motor Rangers' Lost Mine"&mdash;and he
had had no reason to love them.  As ill luck
would have it, he saw the sapphires as they were
spread out before the finders' wondering eyes.
</p>

<p>
The sequel was the pursuit of the Motor
Rangers by Col. Morello and his band, whose
cupidity had been excited by the rich discovery.
The outlaws surrounded the boys and their
friends in a hut in a canyon and escape seemed to
be impossible.  But Nat, by a bit of clever
strategy, managed to slip out, and after a wild ride
through an abandoned lumber flume reached Big
Oak Flat.  A posse was formed and arrived in
time to rescue Cal Gifford and the rest.  But
Morello and his band escaped, only one or two
minor members of the rascally organization being
wounded in the battle that followed the arrival
of the posse.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the sapphires in the care of Sheriff
Jack Tebbetts, of Big Oak Flat, the boys and
their party continued their motoring trip through
the mountains.  At its conclusion they returned
to the primitive settlement only to hear that
Morello had been committing fresh depredations.
Sheriff Tebbetts strongly advised against the
gems being carried through the mountains by
auto on that account.  Thus it came about that
our party came to be riding to the little coast town
of Santa Inez, the trail to which laid through
comparatively settled, orderly country.
</p>

<p>
But we have deserted our friends altogether
too long while we have taken this lengthy but
necessary digression.  Let us now return and
accompany them as they round a turn in the trail
and find themselves zigzagging down the
mountainside in full view of Santa Inez and the
glorious Pacific.
</p>

<p>
"What a queer little town!" exclaimed Nat, as
the panorama below suddenly burst upon them.
</p>

<p>
He gazed in an interested way at the collection
of red-tiled roofs and adobe walls below
them.  Several modern cottages mingled with
the ancient Spanish architecture without
detracting a bit from its quaintness.  Above the other
roofs, and some little distance removed from
them, imposed a tower pierced with numerous
openings, within which swung ancient bells.  This
was the tower of the old mission of Santa Inez.
It had been long abandoned, but still remained a
pathetic monument to a great religious movement.
</p>

<p>
Situated as it was, at the foot of the
mountainside, which was clothed with pungent bay and
madrone trees, and facing a blue bay of horseshoe
shape, a more picturesque little place it
would be hard to imagine.
</p>

<p>
"But the boat?" exclaimed Joe, as they
advanced down the steeply pitched trail.  "I don't
see a sign of her."
</p>

<p>
It was true.  The sparkling, deep blue bay was
empty of life.  That is, if a fair-sized black
schooner, which lay at some little distance
offshore, be excepted.
</p>

<p>
All the party showed their disappointment.
They had confidently expected to behold the trim
outlines of Nat's "Nomad" as soon as they came
in full view of Santa Inez.  Blank looks were
exchanged.  Even Cal, who had had no experience
of the sea and indeed rather mistrusted it, looked
downcast.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe a whale swallered yer ship, Nat," he
ventured.
</p>

<p>
In spite of his chagrin over the non-arrival of
the "Nomad," Nat had to laugh, for Cal had
made the remark just recorded in no joking
sense.  The mountaineer, who had hitherto
obtained only distant glimpses of the ocean, fully
believed it was inhabited by monsters capable of
devouring whole vessels.
</p>

<p>
"There are some big whales in the Pacific, all
right, Cal," said the boy, shoving back his
sombrero, "but I hardly think that any one has yet
heard of one capable of absorbing a sixty-foot
motor boat.  And&mdash;hullo&mdash;what's that?  Hurray!"
</p>

<p>
His cheer was speedily echoed by the others
who had fixed their eyes on him when he broke
off so excitedly in the middle of a sentence.
</p>

<p>
Coming round the southern point of the
horseshoe-shaped bay was a trim and trig white craft
with one slender mast, but no funnel.  She was
coming swiftly, too.  The white foam at her
bow showed how she was cutting through the
water.
</p>

<p>
"'Nomad,' ahoy!" shouted Nat, standing erect
in his stirrups and waving his sombrero, utterly
oblivious of the fact that at that distance it would
have been quite impossible to have seen, much
less heard, him.
</p>

<p>
The others caught his enthusiasm.  Indeed the
"Nomad" was a sight to make the veriest
landsman wax enthusiastic.  As she cut round the
point and neared the land they could catch the
glint of polished brass and wood work when she
rolled to the Pacific swell.
</p>

<p>
Presently the lone figure on her bridge could
be seen to issue an order to another man, who
was on the forward part of the little motor craft.
There was a splash at the "Nomad's" bow, and
she came to a standstill.
</p>

<p>
"Anchored!" cried Nat.
</p>

<p>
At the same instant the figure they had
descried on the bridge was seen running aft.  In
a moment, from the jack-staff astern, appeared
something that made all their hearts beat a bit
faster&mdash;Old Glory!  The land breeze caught the
flag's folds and whipped them out splendidly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, boys, there's the gallant little craft
that will take us all safe to Santa Barbara and
give us many a jolly cruise beside!" cried Nat, a
note of exultation in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Our dream ship!" cried Joe poetically.
</p>

<p>
"Our ter-ter-ter-treasure ship you mean,"
sputtered Ding-dong.  "She'll get the sapphires
safely through and Morello can hang about all
he wants to, waiting for us to show up in the good
old automobile."
</p>

<p>
"Yep, I reckon we've fooled the old coyote this
trip, smart as he is," chuckled Cal, leaning over
to adjust a stirrup leather.
</p>

<p>
As he did so, from the brush which grew close
up to the trail on either side, there came a sharp
snap&mdash;a breaking branch evidently.
</p>

<p>
In the silence that had followed the former
stage driver's remark, the sudden noise sounded
as loud and as startling as a pistol shot.  Cal
straightened up instantly.  But quick as he was,
whoever or whatever had caused the sudden noise
did not further reveal their presence.  The boys
searched about for a bit, but their investigation
was only perfunctory, for they were too eager
to get on board the "Nomad" to spend much time
at anything else.
</p>

<p>
"Guess it must have been a deer, or a rabbit,
or something," said Nat, as they remounted and
set off once more.
</p>

<p>
The others agreed, and thought no more of the
matter.  But Cal belonged to a school that finds
cause for suspicion in any unexplained noise.  It
is an instinct descended to such men from the
harassed pioneers of the Pacific Slope.
</p>

<p>
He frowned to himself as they rode forward,
although he said nothing to the lads of what was
passing in his mind.  But to himself he muttered
seriously enough:
</p>

<p>
"That warn't no rabbit, nor it warn't no deer.
Critters don't bust branches; they're too wise.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
COLONEL MORELLO CHARTERS A SCHOONER.
</h3>

<p>
Cal Gifford had been correct in his guess.
The watcher of the trail was a man, and
probably the last man in the world the boys would
have wished to have in their vicinity just then.
For it was Ed. Dayton who had stepped upon the
branch, much to his chagrin, for the accident
came just at the very moment that he was pretty
sure of overhearing something interesting,
provided he remained silent.
</p>

<p>
Dayton had been rabbit hunting along the trail
when his quick ear had caught the sound of the
approaching party.  With an instinct entirely
natural to a man of his character he had
hastened to conceal himself immediately.  This was
partly, as has been said, by instinct, and partly
from a reasonable sense of prudence; for
Ed. Dayton knew as well as any one else that a
reward had been offered for the capture of any of
the leaders of Morello's gang, and he was
naturally wary of encountering strangers of any
kind.
</p>

<p>
He had never dreamed that the boys were in
that part of the country, and his astonishment at
recognizing their voices first, and then their faces
as he peered through the bushes, was colossal.
The former chauffeur was as quick of wit as he
was lacking in principle, and it had not needed
more than Ding-dong's stuttered hint about the
"treasure ship" to apprise him that he had by,
for him, a lucky accident stumbled once more
across the trail of the sapphires.
</p>

<p>
When the branch had cracked, Dayton, knowing
that a search might ensue, had thrown himself
flat on his stomach and wiggled off across
the ground at a surprising rate.  By the time the
boys had remounted and continued their journey
he had been some distance off, and far on his way
to his destination.  This was a camp well
concealed in a brush-grown cañon up the
mountainside above Santa Inez.
</p>

<p>
On his return he found Colonel Morello himself
gloomily seated in front of his tent, gazing
seaward, for a good view could be obtained of
the ocean from the mountain cañon without
danger of the observers being themselves observed.
Near the leader of the gang which Nat and his
chums had broken up, sat a man in a greasy,
well-worn buckskin suit.  His lank, black hair
dribbled over the collar of his upper garment and
his mahogany-tinted face was shaded by a big
cone-shaped sombrero.  This man was Manuello,
whom our old readers will recall as one of
Colonel Morello's aides in the mountain fortress
from which the boys' efforts had evicted the
lawless crew.  Half a dozen other men lounged
about, smoking and talking.  But an air of
dejection hung about the camp.  It was perceptible
in the men's attitudes no less than in the tones in
which they talked.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Colonel Morello's position was a
precarious one.  It is true that he was well enough
concealed in the cañon above Santa Inez, but it
is equally true that unless he remained there
indefinitely he ran grave risk of being captured
by the indignant authorities.  But Colonel
Morello was not a man who did things without due
thought and preparation.  He was in the vicinity
of Santa Inez for what were, to him, good and
sufficient reasons.  What these were we shall
presently see.  He raised his head from his
reverie as Dayton's step sounded, and looked quickly
up.
</p>

<p>
"Well, here you are back again," he said.
"Have you any news to give us?"
</p>

<p>
The others gathered about eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; is there any vessel in the harbor we can
charter?" asked one eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sick of sneaking and hiding about here,"
put in another.  "You promised us, Morello, when
you brought us here that you would charter a
vessel of some sort on which we could all go to
that island you know of, and keep quiet till things
blew over."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," put in another, a tall, strapping fellow,
in a red shirt, well-worn mackinack trousers, and
much-battered sombrero, "that was the excuse
you gave for retaining possession of the money
we managed to obtain from the fortress before
the pursuit began.  If you don't mean to do
something pretty quick, you had better divide it up
and let us separate and each take our chances
alone."
</p>

<p>
A chorus of assent greeted this proposal.
</p>

<p>
"That's the talk, Swensen," put in one of the
group, Al. Jeffries, the man who had impersonated
a traveler at the Lariat Hotel.  "We want
action, Colonel.  Your plan to get a vessel at this
quiet, out-of-the-way place was a good one.  What
we want is to have it put into practice."
</p>

<p>
"That schooner lying in the bay is the first
vessel to put in here in a week, isn't she?" growled
Colonel Morello, although he was too wise to
adopt anything but a mildly argumentative tone
with his followers.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, but why can't we charter her?"
came from Swensen.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, or that small, white craft that came
round the point a short while ago and anchored
not far from the schooner?" demanded Al. Jeffries.
</p>

<p>
"We have not had time to find out about the
schooner yet," reasoned Colonel Morello, "and
we don't want to spoil things by rushing them.
A little too much haste now might ruin all our
plans.  As for the small white craft&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I can tell you all about her," put in Dayton,
who had stood silently by while this colloquy was
going forward.
</p>

<p>
The others turned on him in some astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"You mean that she can be hired for our
purpose?" he began.  But Dayton interrupted him
with a quick wave of the hand.
</p>

<p>
"I mean," he said, "that she can be no such
thing.  That craft is owned by those pesky young
cubs, the Motor Rangers&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was going on, but a perfect uproar of
exclamations of astonishment interrupted him.
Colonel Morello finally succeeded in quelling the
disturbance and Dayton went on to relate all that
he had overheard while he lay concealed by the
side of the trail.
</p>

<p>
Looks of cupidity passed among the men as he
reached the part of his narrative concerning the
sapphires.  Morello's eyes glistened greedily as
he heard.
</p>

<p>
"Then they have not altogether eluded us," he
said, as if he was busy with some private
thoughts.  "If only we could&mdash;however, that is
neither here nor there.  What concerns us most
now is that the Motor Rangers are at Santa Inez
and that we are within reaching distance of the
lads we have to blame for all our troubles."
</p>

<p>
"I'd give a whole lot to get even on them,"
growled Swensen savagely.
</p>

<p>
But Morello checked him.
</p>

<p>
"That can all be discussed later," he said.
"The thing to be done now is to ascertain if
that schooner can be chartered.  If she can, we
have the money to pay for her, and if she can't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He did not finish, but paused significantly.  His
eyes wandered out over the mountainside and
rested on the "Nomad" as she lay at anchor on
the sun-lit bay.  A small boat could be seen
putting out from her side and the two men in it were
giving way with a will for the shore.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that those are the men who brought
her here from wherever she came from," mused
Morello.  "If only we had a craft like that now."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we haven't," cut in Ed. Dayton, "so the
thing to do now is to see if we can't get the hire
of that schooner.  We could easy sail her.
Swensen here is an old navigator, and the one or two
of the others have been sailors.  I know something
about ships myself."
</p>

<p>
"What do you propose, then?" asked Col. Morello.
</p>

<p>
"That you and I set out for Santa Inez at once
and find out the lay of the land.  If we can
charter the schooner, well and good.  If not&mdash;why
then we'll have to find some other way of getting
out of this hole."
</p>

<p>
It was some hours later that Captain Nelsen
of the smart coasting schooner, "Nettie Nelsen,"
perceived, being pulled toward him from the
shore, a small row boat.  He recognized it as
one of those that were for hire and wondered
whom the two passengers in the stern might be.
He could not imagine who could be coming off
to his vessel while the smart motor boat, which
he had noticed come in that morning, had
dropped anchor some distance off, and not in
the direction in which the shore boat was being
pulled.
</p>

<p>
Captain Nelsen was in a mood in which he
would have welcomed any interruption to his own
thoughts.  Trade was bad for coasting schooners.
Steam craft had taken most of it from the
wind-propelled vessels, and it was only at small,
unfrequented ports like Santa Inez that he could
hope to pick up a cargo.  But there was no
redwood, no hides, and no produce of any kind
awaiting transportation at the old mission town when
the "Nettie Nelsen" dropped anchor there that
morning.  And this had proved the last straw
which broke the back of Captain Nelsen's
fortunes.  His crew, which had only remained with
him in the hopes of obtaining a cargo and thus
getting the means of liquidating their overdue
wages, had deserted in a body when they discovered
that there was no prospect of the "Nettie
Nelsen's" holds being filled at Santa Inez.
</p>

<p>
The desertion had not been mutinous.  The
men admired Captain Nelsen and were sorry for
him.  They had simply informed him that they
could work the ship no longer without pay, and
had gone ashore in a body, to seek their fortunes
elsewhere.  Thus Captain Nelsen was left alone
on his schooner, with his thoughts for company&mdash;and
very poor company he found them, too.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, the desertion of the schooner had
become the cause of considerable talk on shore,
and when Colonel Morello and Dayton, after a
careful reconnaisance, had arrived at the wharf
and hired a boat for transport to the schooner,
one of the first things they heard from their
garrulous boatman was of the strange state of things
on board the deserted craft.  They had exchanged
delighted glances as they heard.  Surely fortune
was favoring them with her smiles once more
after having frowned on them so long.
</p>

<p>
And so it proved.  Captain Nelsen was in no
mood to haggle over the matter of chartering his
schooner.  Colonel Morello secured it for the
sum of five hundred dollars.  There was one
serious drawback, however, according to his way
of thinking, about the arrangements.  Captain
Nelsen insisted on being allowed to navigate his
own vessel.  He had owned and sailed her for
thirty years, he said, and keen as were his
necessities he would rather let her rot than place her
in the hands of strangers.
</p>

<p>
And so Colonel Morello had to make the best
of matters, and agree to carry Captain Nelsen as
his skipper.  As for the simple-minded captain,
he watched the shore boat departing, when
negotiations were completed, with a keen access of joy
such as he had not known for some weeks.
</p>

<p>
"Five hundred dollars," he thought to himself.
"Why, it will make Nettie and the children
hold up their heads again.  Oh, I'm in luck!
It isn't every day that a down-and-out skipper
has a chance of chartering his ship to a party of
scientists on a research expedition to the Marquesas."
</p>

<p>
By which it will be seen that Colonel Morello
had not exactly represented his party in their true
light to the guileless seaman, who was as
unsuspecting as most sailors are.  Indeed, after he
and Dayton had left the boat at the wharf they
began to chuckle over the skipper's simplicity.  It
was almost dark, so that they did not use so much
care to escape observation as they had on their
way to the beach.
</p>

<p>
"Only one thing sticks in my craw," growled
Dayton, "and that is that you gave that old
barnacle five hundred dollars."
</p>

<p>
"I had to," protested the colonel.  "I don't
think he'd have struck a bargain otherwise.  Said
his wife and children needed the money badly and
that he would have to buy extra fittings for the
schooner for such a long voyage as we contemplate."
</p>

<p>
"It's a long voyage, all right," agreed Dayton.
"But if things go through all right, we'll have
taken a wise course.  Your plan is to work our
way through the islands to Australia and then sell
the schooner?"
</p>

<p>
"That's my present idea," rejoined the colonel.
"How do you like it?"
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me to be a good plan," said
Dayton.  "Couldn't be improved on.  But what will
the captain say to our trying to sell his boat?"
</p>

<p>
Morello gave his companion a swift side glance
as they trudged along through the dark streets.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he won't be there to object," he said
significantly.
</p>

<p>
Dayton shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel, you are a wonderful man," he said.
"By the way, what is the name of this friend of
yours in the Marquesas?  Owns a plantation
there, I think you said."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said the colonel; "he's got a
big island and grows cocoanuts.  Haven't seen
him for some years, but I guess he'll be glad to
see me again."
</p>

<p>
"American?" asked Dayton carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I met him in that revolutionary
business in Lower California."
</p>

<p>
"What's his name?"
</p>

<p>
"Gooddale&mdash;Elias Gooddale," was the reply.

CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
LIKE THIEVES IN THE NIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
In the meantime, the Motor Rangers and their
western chum had jogged into the little town,
creating some excitement among the inhabitants
thereof.  Santa Inez was one of those sleepy,
little places not uncommon along the coast of
northern California, connected with the outer world
only by a semi-weekly stage and by an occasional
steamer.  Shut in by the Coast Range to the east,
and the broad Pacific to the west, its inhabitants
lived an almost patriarchal existence.
</p>

<p>
Small and primitive as it was, however, the
place boasted a hotel.  The hostelry was not
large, but still not bad of its kind, and having
inquired the direction the boys made the best of
their time toward it.
</p>

<p>
"I expect Captain Akers will be there already,"
remarked Nat, as they rode through the dusty
street, shaded by feathery pepper trees with
pungent-smelling foliage.
</p>

<p>
"You told him to meet us there, then?" asked Joe.
</p>

<p>
"I did&mdash;yes.  It was in the expectation that he
would arrive there first.  But in any event, it is
no doubt the first place he will make for, expecting
to hear news of us."
</p>

<p>
The party had no difficulty in engaging rooms;
indeed the landlord&mdash;one Calvo Pinto&mdash;appeared
as if he could not do enough for them.  It was
not often that the Gran Hotel De Santa Inez, as
it was grandiloquently called, boasted such a
numerous party of guests.  As Nat told Pinto that
their party might be recruited by two more, the
fellow was naturally obsequious enough.  In fact,
he was servility itself, and bowed and cringed in
most abject fashion.
</p>

<p>
All this super-civility filled Nat with a feeling
of distrust.  However, as they had nothing to be
apprehensive over, he soon dismissed the idea
from his mind.
</p>

<p>
The landlord insisted on helping them stable
their mounts.  They would much have preferred
to perform this duty themselves, but Pinto
seemed to think it a part of his work to aid them,
and they could not peremptorily order him to
leave.  Thus it came about, that when the pack
of the burro was removed, the keen eyes of the
landlord fell on the rather unusual-looking brass
bound box in which the precious sapphires were
carried till they could be given over to the
authorities.
</p>

<p>
He asked many questions concerning the
receptacle, none of which, naturally enough, were
answered other than vaguely.  This served to
increase the landlord's curiosity, but he cunningly
refrained from betraying his inquisitiveness.  His
speculations concerning the strange box were not
allayed when, on his laying hold of it, ostensibly
to help the boys into the hotel, Cal Gifford told
him, rather roughly, to let go.
</p>

<p>
Pinto shrugged his shoulders, but said nothing
but that he was "the servant of the señors, and
their wishes should be respected."
</p>

<p>
After some consultation held in undertones, it
was decided to place the box in the room occupied
by Nat and Joe.  This was at one end of the
hotel and boasted a stout lock on the door.
Beneath the window was the flat roof of a porch.
</p>

<p>
"Handy in case of fire," remarked Nat, looking out.
</p>

<p>
"That's right," agreed Joe, "but has it
occurred to you that it would be equally handy for
any intruders who might wish to examine the
box?"
</p>

<p>
"You mean the landlord?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't exactly like the way he looked
at it."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw," scoffed Nat, "what could a puny rat
like that do against four able-bodied persons&mdash;not
to mention Captain Akers and the man we
noticed helping him on the 'Nomad.'  However,
we will keep watch to-night if you like.  Hullo"&mdash;he
broke off suddenly as voices were heard on
the porch below&mdash;"there's Captain Akers now.
He must have just come ashore.  Let's shove the
box in under the bed and go down and meet him.
I'm dying to hear how the 'Nomad' behaved on
her trip up the coast."
</p>

<p>
Locking the door behind them, the two lads
descended.  On the landing they met Cal Gifford
and Ding-dong Bell who shared the next room
to themselves.  Both had had a good wash-up,
as had Nat and Joe, and the party looked
considerably spruced up from the travel-stained
individuals who had entered the hotel a short time
before.
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers, a bluff, blond-bearded seaman,
greeted them effusively.  He knew all of them
except Cal.  The mountaineer and the sailor
shook hands with a feeling of mutual respect as
they surveyed each other.  Both were men of
action and decision and recognized those qualities
in the other.
</p>

<p>
The captain's assistant on board the "Nomad"
turned out to be a slender yet muscular youth,
introduced by the mariner as Sam Hinckley.  He
was a capable young chap, said the captain, and
had been of the greatest assistance to him when
the "Nomad's" engine became cantankerous in a
blow she had encountered on her way up the coast.
It was this that had caused the delay.  But
Hinckley, who possessed a wonderful knowledge
of marine gasolene engines, had managed to adjust
the difficulty more speedily than the captain
would have thought possible.
</p>

<p>
Presently, after an enthusiastic discussion of
the boat and her good points, Captain Akers drew
Nat aside.
</p>

<p>
"I regard this young chap Hinckley as quite a
find," he said.  "He presented himself at the boat
yard some time ago and said he was looking for
work.  Although I didn't much need a hand, I
tried him out and he proved himself so capable
that he was hired regularly.  He has rather a
remarkable history.  It seems that he hails from
the South Seas&mdash;somewhere in the Marquesas
Group, I believe.  He left there on account of some
trouble he had with a relative.  He did not confide
to me what it was and since he did not seem
anxious to let me know, I have never pressed him
on this part of his history.  It was sufficient for
me to know that I had a good, capable workman
who, so far as I have been able to observe, is as
honest as the day is long, and a thorough seaman."
</p>

<p>
"He looks all of that," agreed Nat, with a
glance at Hinckley's broad shoulders and
upright bearing.  The young sailor stood chatting
with the others at some little distance down the
hotel porch.
</p>

<p>
"And now what do you say if we go out and
inspect the 'Nomad'?" asked Captain Akers.
</p>

<p>
This was a proposal which naturally met with
no negative votes.  But right here a problem
presented itself.  Who was to stay to guard the
sapphires; for, of course, such a thing as leaving
them unwatched was not to be thought of.  The
question was settled by Cal Gifford, who insisted
on remaining behind.  Maybe the mountaineer
was anxious to postpone his introduction to Old
Ocean.  At any rate, he seemed anxious to
remain, so the boys, who were dancing about with
impatience to inspect the "Nomad," did not press
him very hard to change his resolution, as that
would have meant that one of their number must
remain on shore.
</p>

<p>
The "Nomad" proved all that Captain Akers
had claimed for her.  Her main cabin was roomy
and provided with a stateroom for "the owner,"
and several berths of the type used on sleeping
cars which folded up during the day or when
they were not in use.  Aft of the main cabin came
a tiny galley, fitted with bright, new utensils, and
opposite was a washroom.
</p>

<p>
A short flight of steps led to the cockpit,
forward of which the engines were located, being
reached by a door from the cabin.  The cockpit
was of the shallow, self-baling type.  From it a
short flight of steps led to a miniature "bridge"
placed athwartship on top of the cabin.  This was
surmounted by a "military-mast," with cross-trees
and halliards for hoisting signals.
</p>

<p>
There were other features about the "Nomad"
which will be mentioned as occasion arises.  The
boys enthusiastically voted her a perfect little
ship.
</p>

<p>
"She's capable of taking a cruise almost
anywhere!" declared Nat.
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she has large auxiliary tanks for
carrying an extra supply of gasolene.  Her engines
are so constructed, moreover, that they will
consume kerosene just as well as gasolene, so that
if you ever get in a part of the world where
gasolene is unobtainable you can burn the other fuel,
which can be found almost anywhere on the
globe."
</p>

<p>
"What if the engines break down?" asked Joe
Hartley, with the air of one who has propounded
a poser.
</p>

<p>
"In that case all we have to do," responded
Captain Akers, "is to take to sail.  The 'Nomad'
has an extra deep keel, fitted for just that purpose."
</p>

<p>
"But the masts?" demanded Joe.
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers raised the hinged lid of one of
the lockers that ran the length of the cockpit.
Inside were several lengths of rounded, varnished
timber, fitted with brass sockets.  They may be
compared to the dissembled sections of a fishing
rod.
</p>

<p>
"There are our masts," he said.  "Sockets have
been provided, fore and aft, for the reception of
their 'heels.'  Everything is ready to attach their
stays and rigging to.  The sails are in that other
locker.  The 'Nomad' can be equipped for sail
in less than half an hour."
</p>

<p>
The boys exchanged radiant glances.  Truly
there seemed nothing wanting to make the
"Nomad" as complete a little vessel as could be
desired.  The inspection completed, they rowed
shoreward once more.  They found Cal on the
watch, but nothing had occurred to require his
attention.  The remainder of the afternoon was
spent in strolling about the little town and
buying a few necessities for the voyage down the
coast, for it had been determined that the start
would be made in the morning, there being
nothing to delay our adventurers at Santa Inez.
</p>

<p>
"How I wish we were going to cruise to the
South Seas," sighed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, maybe we will some day," put in
Joe.  "The Motor Rangers seem to be always
running into adventures of all kinds."
</p>

<p>
That his prophecy was to be verified, and that
in no very short time, never occurred to Joe, and
as for the others, they concluded that, having
reached Santa Inez in safety, they were through
with the most risky part of their expedition.
Little did they imagine that their adventures had not
yet begun.
</p>

<p>
All hands turned in early that night, for a
quick start was to be made on the morrow.  Sam
Hinckley rowed off to the "Nomad" after supper
to keep watch and ward over her for the night,
while the rest sought their previously assigned
sleeping quarters in the hotel.
</p>

<p>
Folks retired early to bed in Santa Inez and
by ten o'clock most of the lights in the place were
out.  It was about this time that two figures
appeared in front of the hotel, taking care,
however, to keep in the dark shade of the pepper trees
lining the opposite sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
The two men watched the hotel for some time
in silence, listening while the landlord went his
nightly rounds, testing locks and fastening the
lower windows.  By and by he, too, vanished,
and before long his light, which had appeared at
an upper window, was extinguished.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we try for it now?" asked one of the
men, slouching in the obscurity of the tree shadows.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, Dayton.  Give them time to get settled
down to sleep.  Is everything in readiness?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, colonel.  While you went to the camp to
tell the men to be ready to embark to-night, I
arranged for a boat.  She is at the wharf now.  All
we have to do is to secure that chest, join the
rest of the boys, get on board the schooner and
then, 'Ho for the Marquesas!'"
</p>

<p>
"You talk as if it were all accomplished."
</p>

<p>
"And so it is, to all intents and purposes.  We
know the room where the boys are sleeping.
That garrulous old fool of a landlord told us,
when we dropped into his drinking bar, that the
chest was in Nat Trevor's room.  All we have to
do, then, is to climb that trellis work leading up
to the porch roof, walk in through the open
window, and make good our escape."
</p>

<p>
"What if they make any resistance?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think they will," said Dayton, grimly
fingering his revolver as he spoke; "but if they
do, we can easily subdue them."
</p>

<p>
"But they may raise the whole town about our
ears," objected Colonel Morello, who seemed to
be weakening now that the actual moment for
carrying out their rascally plan had arrived.
Dayton, on the contrary, was confident as if they
already had the sapphires on board the "Nettie
Nelsen."
</p>

<p>
"Let them raise the town if they want to,"
scoffed Morello's lieutenant.  "The boys are waiting
at the landing, and at the first sign of trouble
they'll start a fusillade that will scare the life
out of any one who tries to interfere.  Now, then,
you remain on watch here.  I'm going to see how
the coast lies."
</p>

<p>
Morello nodded.  The next moment he was
alone, while Dayton, swiftly but silently, glided
across the dark street.  He gained the foot of
the trellis work, glanced upward for a minute,
and then setting his foot in the criss-cross work
began to climb.  He made no more noise than a
marauding cat.
</p>

<p>
His companion, watching nervously from the
dark shadows, saw Dayton's form gain the porch
roof, slip noiselessly across it to the boys' window,
and cautiously push aside the shade.
</p>

<p>
The next instant he stepped through the
casement and disappeared from Morello's view.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
RUN DOWN
</h3>

<p>
Some half hour later Dayton and Morello,
carrying the heavy box between them, reached the
wharf where the boat they had already mentioned
was in waiting.  The rest of their rascally
companions were there already, impatiently
awaiting the word to "shove off."  The boat was one
of the schooner's own and in the stern sheets sat
Captain Nelsen himself.
</p>

<p>
"So the boy never wakened," Colonel Morello
said, with a low chuckle, as they neared the
wharf.
</p>

<p>
"No," rejoined Dayton, in a sinister tone, "and
if he had, it would have been mighty unhealthy
for him.  Luckily, though, he had evidently fallen
asleep while he was sitting up in a chair guarding
the stuff.  It was no trick at all to get it out from
under the bed, where they had it stowed, and
lower it to you by that rope fire escape."
</p>

<p>
"Well, all is well that ends well," said
Morello, as they stepped down on the landing place.
"But I confess that I was nervous while you were
in that room.  Now, captain, if you are ready,
we will embark without further delay."
</p>

<p>
"Budt I am nodt retty, by der greadt Horn
Schpoon," sputtered Captain Nelsen, in whose
stolid mind suspicion had for some time been
waxing strong.  "It looks to me, by Dunder, dot
der vos some dings crooked here, alreatty yedt.
Vot for you vant to gedt off by der schooner adt
midnighdt?  Vot you godt in dot box?"
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for an answer to his questions,
he thrust his hand into his breast pocket
and fished out a battered wallet.
</p>

<p>
"Here," he said, "I gif you back your moneys.
I dond't vant to be mixed up in noddings dot looks
so suspicibrious as dis sort of vork.  You can'
haf no monkey business by my schooner.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Before the honest captain could say another
word a coat was thrown over his head by one of
the men in the boat and he was violently thrown
down on the thwarts.  But if they thought they
were going to subdue Captain Nelsen without a
struggle, Morello's rascals were mistaken.  The
mariner, with muscles hardened in many a blow
and time of stress at sea, battled like a wild cat.
But, at last, sheer force of numbers outgeneraled
him, and he was compelled to lie quiet at the
bottom of his own boat.
</p>

<p>
"I'd have silenced him with an oar if that had
kept up any longer," commented Dayton grimly.
"We've lost a lot of valuable time already.  Come,
boys, tie that fellow up, and then give way for
the schooner, lively.  We'll&mdash;&mdash;  What's that?"
</p>

<p>
As he uttered the abrupt exclamation, from
the direction of the town there came a sound of
shouting and uproar.
</p>

<p>
"They've discovered the theft!" gasped Morello
scrambling into the boat after Dayton.  "Pull
for your lives, boys.  It's prison if they catch
us."
</p>

<p>
The men did not need this warning to make
them give way with a will.  The boat, bearing in
it the unconscious captain, fairly flew over the
water toward the dark outline of the schooner.
In the meantime, the hubbub ashore increased.
Lights could be seen flashing in every direction.
Shouts and cries were borne clearly over the
water.
</p>

<p>
"We can laugh at all that once we are on
board and the anchors weighed," muttered
Dayton.  "There's a good breeze springing up, and
by dawn we ought to be twenty miles out at sea."
</p>

<p>
But Colonel Morello suddenly recollected
something that dashed their enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Those boys have a motor boat!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Concern it all, that's so," snarled Dayton.
"Let's see, we've got to do some quick thinking.
Is the tide setting in or out?"
</p>

<p>
"It's going out," said one of the oarsmen.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever has that to do with the matter?"
snapped Colonel Morello impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Everything," was Dayton's reply.  "Boys,
pull us over toward that motor boat.  There&mdash;off
in that direction&mdash;you can just see her white
outline."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean to do?" asked Morello
nervously.  "We've no time to waste on
foolish notions."
</p>

<p>
"This isn't a foolish notion, as you'll see,"
replied the other.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes more rowing brought them to
the side of the motor boat.  All was silent on
board, Hinckley being asleep in the cabin.
Captain Akers had told him that it would not be
necessary to keep a strict watch, and he was making
up for lost sleep on the rough voyage up by a
sound slumber.
</p>

<p>
As they drew longside the "Nomad," it was
seen that her stern was swung seaward, showing
that the strong tide which set out of the bay was
dragging her Pacificward.  The anchor cable
was drawn taut as a fiddle string under the
strain.
</p>

<p>
Dayton stood up in the boat, and with one slash
of his heavy knife he severed the stout rope, the
few strands which he had not cut through parting
under the strain of the tide-swung craft.
</p>

<p>
He gave a low chuckle as the "Nomad," anchorless
and adrift, began to glide out to sea at
quite a swift pace.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," he laughed, "I guess we are ready
for the schooner.  From her decks we could
stand off an army in rowboats, and that is the
only kind of craft they can obtain now."
</p>

<p>
By the time they reached the schooner's side,
so rapidly had the tide done its work, that the
"Nomad" had completely vanished in the darkness,
not even a dim white blur of her form showing up.
</p>

<p>
"I guess this is the time that we have the
Motor Rangers checkmated to a standstill,"
muttered Dayton to himself, as he climbed up the
side of the "Nettie Nelsen."  "By the time they
recover their boat we shall be miles at sea and
beyond danger of pursuit."
</p>

<p>
Presently they had all gained the decks of the
vessel, the chest and the unconscious form of poor
Captain Nelsen being handed up, after the boat
had been hauled up on the stern davits.  This
done, the men, under the directions of the gigantic
Swensen, the former sailor, set about heaving
the anchor and ungasketing the sails preparatory
to leaving the bay with all the speed they could
command.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, let us go back and see what
had been occurring ashore.  As the astute Dayton
had surmised, Nat, who was on watch, but had
been overcome by weariness, had awakened with
a start a few minutes after the two rascals had
set out for the wharf with the chest.
</p>

<p>
Directly he opened his eyes, one of those
strange intuitions that come to us all at times
apprised him that all was not well.  Gazing about
him, the first thing the lad noticed was that the
window blind was shoved aside.  It had been left
that way by Dayton in the invader's hasty exit.
With a queer sensation of dread, Nat, broad
awake now, sprang from the chair in which he
had dozed off, and made for the bed under which
the chest had been hidden.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing there.
</p>

<p>
With a shout of consternation, the boy staggered
back, fairly dazed by the disaster.  But
Nat was not a boy to remain uselessly thunderstruck
for more than a few seconds.  Recovering
his wits, he instantly realized what must have
occurred.  Somebody had entered the room by
means of the porch roof and stolen the chest.
</p>

<p>
But who?
</p>

<p>
As we know, none of the boys had any idea
of the close vicinity of Colonel Morello's band.
They deemed them, in fact, far from there, in
the fastnesses of the Sierras.  Nat's first
suspicious thought then flashed on the landlord.  The
man's interest in the chest, his furtive eye and
servile manner, all rushed back into the lad's
recollection.
</p>

<p>
He hastily aroused Joe and apprised him of the
startling thing that had occurred.  Joe, scarcely
less taken aback than Nat, was out of bed in an
instant.  Together the two boys made all speed
to the room occupied by Cal and Ding-dong Bell.
The mountaineer sprang to his feet with a roar
of rage as Nat communicated his dire tidings.
He hastily threw on his clothes, and while the
rest did the same examined his revolver.
</p>

<p>
"I've a notion I may have ter use you afore
the night is over," he said, addressing the
well-worn weapon as if it had been a sentient being.
</p>

<p>
As soon as they assembled once more&mdash;which
was within a few minutes&mdash;Cal burst out with:
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet the hole in a doughnut that this here
robbery has something to do with that crackling
we heard in the chaparral this afternoon.  I was
pretty sure then that the noise was made by some
coyote a-listenin' to our talk.  I'm sure of it now.
Whoever it was&mdash;and I suspect it was one of that
Morello crowd&mdash;they heard enough to put them
wise to the fact that we had the sapphires and
meant to stop in Santa Inez ter-night.  Ther rest
was easy for them."
</p>

<p>
"But it would not have been had it not been
for my neglect of my duty in going to sleep,"
said Nat bitterly.  "It's all my fault.  I ought to
be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There, lad, no use in crying over spilt milk,"
comforted Cal.  "The thing ter do now is to find
the robbers.  They kain't hev got very far.  And
when we do find them thar'll be some fireworks."
</p>

<p>
Nat hastily communicated his suspicion about
the landlord.  Cal shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet he's in bed and asleep," he said.  And
so, on investigation, it proved.  The man, however,
was honest enough to relate in full to the
boys the conversation he had had in his drinking
bar with the two strangers.  From his description
they at once recognized that Cal had been right
and that in all probability the marauders were
Morello and Dayton.
</p>

<p>
The landlord volunteered to rout out his friends
and form a strong posse, and this was the cause
of the shouts and cries that the rascals who had
stolen the sapphires and set the "Nomad" adrift
had heard.  But having no idea in which direction
the men could have gone, it was some time
before Nat suggested searching the water-front.
All that time had been lost in aimless hunting
about under the direction of the chief of police
of Santa Inez, who was also the main part of
its police force.
</p>

<p>
However, the landlord had succeeded in rousing
twenty or thirty citizens, all of whom were
armed, so that the posse was quite a formidable
one.  As they reached the water-front, Cal
enjoined silence.
</p>

<p>
"If so be as they've took ter a boat," he said,
"by listening quietly we kin hear ther oars."
</p>

<p>
But they listened for some minutes without
hearing a sound.  Suddenly Nat's sharp ears
caught an odd noise.  The lad, born and brought
up by the sea, instantly recognized it.  It was the
"cheep-cheep" of blocks.
</p>

<p>
"It's that schooner," he cried, pointing to the
dark blot the vessel made against the night.
"They're getting up sail."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible that any one on board her could
have anything to do with the robbery," decided
the chief of police sagely.  "I've known Captain
Nelsen for many years," he went on, "and he is
as honest as daylight."
</p>

<p>
"Just the same, there is something mighty
queer about a schooner getting up sail at midnight,"
observed Nat.  "If we can get a boat, I'm
going to look into the matter."
</p>

<p>
Although the chief looked dubious, and many
of the others in the posse opined that they were
wasting time, Nat finally gained his point.  Three
dories were found and commandeered and the little
flotilla set off through the darkness toward
the schooner.  As they neared her the rattle of
anchor chain as it was reeled home was distinctly
heard.  Also they could catch the sound
of commands being given in low voices.
</p>

<p>
"By Hookey, they are getting her ready for
sea," muttered the chief, in a surprised tone.  "I
guess you were right, boy.  This looks very
suspicious."
</p>

<p>
"We'd better give them a hail," suggested Nat.
</p>

<p>
The chief stood up in the boat, in which,
beside Nat and himself, were Joe, Cal, and
Ding-dong Bell.
</p>

<p>
"Schooner ahoy!" he hailed.  "We want to
board you!"
</p>

<p>
The reply was prompt and removed all doubts
as to the character of those on board the craft.
</p>

<p>
A flash of light split the night, followed by a
sharp report.  Nat, who was standing upright
by the chief, felt the bullet fan his ear.
</p>

<p>
"That's for a warning," came a harsh voice.
"Stand clear of this schooner, or you'll get more."
</p>

<p>
But the chief of police was by no means a
coward, and this answer, instead of intimidating
him, aroused him to fury.
</p>

<p>
"I am chief of police of this town," he cried.
"In the name of the law, I command you to lay to."
</p>

<p>
A sneering laugh was the only rejoinder.  It
was followed, however, by a scattering fire.
</p>

<p>
This was the last straw with the chief.
</p>

<p>
"Let 'em have it, boys!" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
In obedience to his command the posse opened
fire on the dark form of the schooner.  It is
doubtful, however, if they did much damage, as the
night was too black to make out more than her
outline.
</p>

<p>
But the men on board now had the sails up.
The pyramids of canvas loomed up like spires
against the dark background of the night.  The
rushing of water under her forefoot as she began
to move could be distinctly heard.
</p>

<p>
"By Thunder, we'll stop that craft, or know the
reason why," roared the chief.
</p>

<p>
At that same instant there came a shout from
the schooner's bow.
</p>

<p>
"Out of the road, or we'll run you down, you
swabs!"
</p>

<p>
"Great Heavens!" cried Nat.  "They've
changed their course.  Out of the way, quick, or
they'll sink us!"
</p>

<p>
But before any one in the boat had recovered
his wits at this sudden and dangerous turn of
events, the great form of the schooner loomed
above them like some menacing tower.
</p>

<p>
"Back water!  Back water!" screamed Nat.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p59"></a>
But before he could utter another word, there
was a terrific shock.  The schooner's sharp bow
had crashed clean into the boat.  The air was
filled with shouts and cries.
</p>

<p>
Nat felt the boat sinking under him, and,
mustering all his strength, he sprang upward aiming
for the "dolphin striker," which loomed right
above him.
</p>

<p>
But even as he sprang he felt a sudden sharp
pain pass through him.  A million constellations
swam sparklingly before his eyes and then his
senses went out amid the turmoil about him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
NAT IN DIRE STRAITS.
</h3>

<p>
Nat's returning senses did not come to him till
some time later.  When they did they revealed
his situation as one of the strangest, surely, in
which any lad was ever placed.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!" thought Nat, as his eyes
opened.  "What can have&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Swash!
</p>

<p>
A mass of green water swept over him, choking
the words back down his throat and half drowning
him.  But the immersion in the not-over chilly
water revived him fully and a few seconds
sufficed to show him that he was lying half across
the bobstay of the schooner's bowsprit, just aft
of the "dolphin striker"&mdash;as the sharp spar that
sticks out beneath the bowsprit is called.
</p>

<p>
There was a dull throbbing in Nat's head and
he felt numb and stiff.  But another roller breaking
over him at that instant, as the schooner took
a plunge, convinced him that he must muster
all his strength to get out of his perilous position
or be miserably drowned.
</p>

<p>
A pallid, gray dawn lay over the waters and
Nat, after he had, by a supreme effort, worked
his way up the bobstay to a higher position, saw
to his dismay that the schooner must be some
distance out at sea.  She seemed to be rushing
through the water at a speed which he estimated
at about ten knots an hour.  Allowing then that
the time was about four-thirty, she must have
made some forty miles or more since midnight.
</p>

<p>
Nat placed his hand to his head, which ached
cruelly.  He found that it was cut quite badly,
but luckily the wound was only a flesh one and
his involuntary salt water bath had washed it
clean.
</p>

<p>
"When the schooner struck the boat," he
mused.  "I remember jumping upward and nothing
after that.  The dolphin striker must have
hit me but it seems I had wits enough left to cling
on to the bobstay.  A good thing I had, too, or
I'd be in Davy Jones' locker by this time.  I
wonder what became of the rest of them.  Thank
goodness, Joe, Ding-dong, and Cal can all swim,
and if they were not knocked insensible they are
all right."
</p>

<p>
Nat looked about him once more.  Above him
the jibs of the schooner were bellying whitely out
under the fresh breeze.  Beneath him the water
boiled under the smart craft's sharp prow.  All
about&mdash;the rising sun gilding it&mdash;was the heaving
waste of the broad Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Truly Nat was in a quandary.  Remain where
he was he could not.  Even had it not been for
the impossibility of doing without food or water
he could momentarily feel himself growing
weaker.  Before the cut in his head had stopped
bleeding, he reasoned that he must have lost
considerable vital fluid.
</p>

<p>
"What am I to do?" thought Nat to himself.
"I recognized Morello's voice when he shouted
that warning just before the boat was struck.
My life aboard this schooner will be worth just
about what it would be in a den of savage tigers.
Even if it were not for the grudge Morello owes
me for betraying his fortress in the Sierras, he
has sufficient reason to wish me out of the way.
What am I to do?" he concluded, with the same
question with which he had begun his gloomy
ruminations.
</p>

<p>
The question was unexpectedly answered for
him.  Swensen, in his capacity as sailing master
of the schooner, came forward at that moment to
look at the headsails.  After peering aloft in
sailor fashion he squinted over the bow to see
how the "Nettie Nelsen" was cleaving the waters.
Hardly had he poked his blond head over the bow
before he became aware of Nat clinging to his
precarious perch, and busy with his gloomy
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Hul-lo!" he roared.  "Dere bane boy on der
bobstay, by Yiminy!"
</p>

<p>
His shout brought Morello and Dayton and
half a dozen others&mdash;among them the ill-favored
Manuello&mdash;to the bow.  They echoed the Swede's
shout, as in the wet-through, miserable figure
clinging to the bobstay and looking up at them
they recognized the boy who had done more than
any one else to bring their rascally careers to a
termination.
</p>

<p>
For a breath absolute silence reigned.  Nat,
who had looked up at the sudden shout of the
Swede and seen the latter's shock head peering
down at him, kept still because he felt that it was
useless to do anything else.  Morello and the
others were tongue-tied temporarily from sheer,
crass, amazement.
</p>

<p>
They had confidently believed that when they
sunk the boat they had likewise sunk all on board
her, or, failing that, had at least shaken off all
pursuit.  But here, confronting them like a
ghost, was the form of the boy they most hated
and detested.  Morello's eyes fairly snapped
delight as he beheld Nat thus thrust into his power.
The evil glint of his black orbs found an answering
expression of joy in Dayton's.  The rascals
could hardly believe their luck.  Morello was the
first to gain his voice.
</p>

<p>
"So," he snarled, with his sinister sneer more
marked than ever, "we meet again, Señor Motor
Ranger.  But the circumstances are rather
different to what they were in the cañon."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," rejoined Nat calmly, "there, if I recollect
rightly, you all were running for your lives."
</p>

<p>
"You forget the old proverb, Señor Trevor:
'He who fights and runs away will live to fight
some other day.'  However, you see now that it
is verified.  Here are we with a fine schooner
under our feet, your sapphires in our possession,
and the world before us.  While you&mdash;&mdash;  Well,
I would not be in your shoes for a good deal."
</p>

<p>
He chuckled in an ominous manner as he spoke.
Nat said nothing.  He felt it would be utterly
useless to reply to the man.  Wholly in the power
of the merciless ruffians, as he knew himself to
be, he felt that his best policy lay in not
irritating them any further than possible.
</p>

<p>
"Are you coming on deck, or would you prefer
to be thrown into the sea?" sneered Ed. Dayton
savagely, casting a look of hatred on Nat.
</p>

<p>
"I'd prefer to come on deck," responded Nat,
determined not to show a trace of the real fear
that he felt.  "If you'll throw me a rope, I can
scramble up."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we'll throw you a rope fast enough,"
grinned Morello maliciously.  "Maybe it will be
a rope to hang yourself with."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, in a few seconds a rope with a
noose in the end of it came snaking down, and
Nat, fastening the noose under his armpits, was
drawn up over the bow and an instant later he
stood on the swaying foredeck of the "Nettie
Nelsen" in the midst of his enemies.
</p>

<p>
The group gathered there scowled at the lad
with malevolent expressions, but none of them
made a move to touch him.  Perhaps they felt
that he was so completely in their power now
that it was no use hastening their revenge.
Morello fairly gloated as he regarded the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is luck," he exclaimed; "a bit of
unheard-of good fortune.  Here we are fleeing from
the place from which you and your brats of
companions drove us, and we actually pick you up off
our bowsprit forty miles out at sea."
</p>

<p>
"The question is what are you going to do with
me?" spoke up Nat boldly enough, though his
heart sank direfully.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that we have not yet decided," chuckled
Morello, rubbing his hands; "but you must know
that I am notable for avenging myself on those
who have wronged me."
</p>

<p>
"Wronged you," burst out Nat.  "I should
think that having been driven from the Sierras,
and your lawless ways terminated, that you would
have decided that an honest life would be best,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stopped short as Ed. Dayton, unable to
control himself any longer, made two swift steps
toward the boy he hated, and, raising his hand,
struck Nat a blow across the face before the
lad had time to defend himself.  But while the
malicious grin still hovered on Dayton's face and
he was still exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"That's for the blow you gave me at Santa
Barbara," Nat was upon him.
</p>

<p>
The cowardly bully was no match for the
wiry, muscular lad, weakened by exposure and
his wound, though the latter might be.  Dayton
came crashing down to the deck with Nat on
the top of him before any of the others, who had
been completely taken by surprise, could interfere.
</p>

<p>
The instant they recovered their senses the
rascally crew hurled themselves upon Nat, beating
and cuffing him.  Kicks were not spared, either.
It would have gone hard with the lad if Colonel
Morello's voice had not suddenly struck in.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!  Stop that instantly!  Manuello!  You,
Larson; you, Britt and Hicks!  Let that boy up!"
</p>

<p>
Grumblingly they arose, leaving Nat lying half
unconscious on the deck.  Casting the lad's limp
form to one side, Dayton, too, got on his feet,
pouring forth a torrent of foul language.
</p>

<p>
"It served you right, Dayton," was all the
comfort he obtained from Colonel Morello.  "The
boy is absolutely in our power.  There is no need
for haste in taking our revenge."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to make the cub walk the plank,"
bellowed Dayton, feeling his eye, which was rapidly
swelling where Nat's fist had struck it.
</p>

<p>
"We will think of something better than
that&mdash;something more original," purred the colonel, in
his silkiest tones.  "In the meantime, you, Hicks,
and you, Britt, take this young whelp down to the
forehold.  Tie him to a stanchion down there till
I get ready to deal with him."
</p>

<p>
Nat, who had by this time staggered painfully
to his feet, could not repress a shudder at the
words and at the tone in which they were spoken.
To his chagrin, his temporary accession of
weakness was swiftly noted by Morello, who grinned
delightedly.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you may well shudder," he exclaimed.
"Bolder people than you have shuddered and
turned pale before when they faced Colonel
Morello."
</p>

<p>
Nat did not reply.  For one thing he felt
weak and dizzy.  His head had started bleeding
again, following his struggle with Dayton and
his subsequent suppression.  Moreover, he was in
need of food and water.  To his surprise, as he
was led away by Britt and Hicks, Colonel Morello
gave the men orders to feed the boy as soon as
possible.
</p>

<p>
"We don't want him to die before we are
through with him," he explained to Dayton, who
was inclined to protest against this seeming
humanity.
</p>

<p>
The young Motor Ranger did not hear this remark.
It was as well that he did not.  His spirits
were quite low enough already.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
THE VOICE IN THE DARK.
</h3>

<p>
The forehold into which Nat was conducted
proved to be a dark, musty smelling place.
Stanchions, like the pillars of a church, held up the
deck above them.  By the hollow ring of his and
his guardians' feet on the floor Nat could tell
that there must be yet another hold below the
one in which it seemed he was to be made prisoner.
</p>

<p>
The men, none too gently, secured him hand
and foot to one of the stanchions.  Then, without
a word, they turned and left him, ascending the
steep ladder by which they had entered the hold.
The next instant the light which filtered into the
hold through the hatchway was shut out as the
aperture was closed with a bang.
</p>

<p>
Nat, weak, drenched, and half starved, and
wounded moreover, found himself in total
blackness.  He could move neither hand nor foot,
although the instant the light was excluded he
could hear the scuttling of huge ship rats all
about him.
</p>

<p>
Brave as the boy was who shall blame him if,
for a few moments, he gave way utterly and
shouted and raved at the top of his voice.  But a
calmer interval succeeded.  That wonderful
little lamp which we call hope, and which persists
in lighting up the darkest places, still
burned&mdash;though dimly&mdash;in Nat's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Come," he thought to himself, "giving way
like a baby will do me no good.  Perhaps some
way will appear of escape from this situation.
When I was Morello's prisoner in the fortress in
the Sierras things looked almost as bad, but
they came out all right in the end.  All I can do
is to keep on hoping, anyway.  If it only wasn't
for those horrible rats, I'd feel better."
</p>

<p>
The loathsome creatures scampered round
Nat's feet and legs and occasionally he could
almost feel them touch him.
</p>

<p>
"Scat!" he would cry out at such moments, but
that only produced a temporary panic among the
noisome vermin.  The next instant they would
be back again.  And they grew bolder every time.
It seemed to Nat almost as if they knew he was
nothing but a helpless prisoner.
</p>

<p>
After what appeared ages of time had elapsed,
the hatchway opened once more and Britt and
Hicks reappeared.  They brought with them two
steaming dishes of food and a jug of water.
Setting these down as they arrived at Nat's side,
they loosened his arm bonds to allow him to eat.
His legs, however, were still secured tightly to
the stanchion.
</p>

<p>
"Don't see what the skipper wants ter give
yer a thing ter eat fer," growled the man Britt,
savagely glaring at Nat.  "If I wuz him, I'd
starve you to death."
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt it," said Nat, cheerfully taking
a long pull at the water pitcher.  Then he proceeded
to pitch into the two tin pans which proved
to contain, one of them a sort of stew and the
other some potatoes.
</p>

<p>
"If it hadn't bin fer you and them other
whelps," snarled Hicks, "we'd a bin in ther Sierras
right now, instid of bin aboard this old
windjammer bound fer the South Seas.  What's ther
name uv ther place again, Britt?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, ther island is called Ho-dear-me, or
some sich name.  It's in the Mar-kiss-us group."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear me, eh?" snarled Hicks.  "Wall,
that'll be a good name fer it so far as this
younker is consarned.  I overheard Morello telling
Dayton a while ago that he meant ter keep ther
kid in suspense till we reached the island and
then take his revenge on him in some novel sort
of a way."
</p>

<p>
"And no more than he deserves, the sneaking,
young cur," grated out Britt.  "I'd keel haul him.
That's what I'd do."
</p>

<p>
As may be imagined, this conversation interested
as well as dismayed Nat.  After he had finished
his meal and the men, with curses, rebound
him and then left the hold, he fell to thinking
hard over what he had heard.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's evident," mused Nat, "that Morello
is seeking some safe asylum where he can hide
from the long arm of the law.  I guess from what
those two fellows said the island he is bound for
is some place down in the Marquesas Group,
although what particular island Oh-dear-me, as
they called it, can be I have no idea.  If only I
could see an atlas!"
</p>

<p>
As this thought flashed through his mind, Nat
gave a sad smile.  It had just occurred to him
that if he could see an atlas, he would be free.
He resumed his reverie.  For one thing, by
keeping his mind busy he managed to prevent himself
from dwelling too much on the utter apparent
hopelessness of his position, for another, it made
the time pass more quickly.
</p>

<p>
One thing cast a ray of light into his gloomy
state of mind, and that was that from what Britt
and Hicks had said it seemed that he was not
to meet his fate till they reached the island.  Nat
began to hope that between the present and that
time some sort of opportunity to escape might
present itself.
</p>

<p>
If only he could get some word to his friends,
but that was an impossibility, so absolute as not
to bear thinking about.  No, whatever was to be
accomplished would have to be carried out by Nat
himself.  That much was evident.
</p>

<p>
But a relapse came following his temporary
accession of better spirits.  How was he, a lad,
alone among so many ferocious enemies, to
accomplish anything?  No, it was impossible.  He
had been a fool ever to think that there was a
chance for him to escape.  He would be
slaughtered&mdash;perhaps tortured&mdash;he had heard of such
things&mdash;by Morello and his men, and then cast
into an unmarked grave in some desolate tropic
isle.  The thought was too much to bear.
</p>

<p>
"I won't die like that!  I won't!  I won't!"
screamed Nat, in a perfect frenzy.
</p>

<p>
But he checked his outburst suddenly.  A chill
of horror crept over him.  Was he beginning to
lose his senses in the darkness?
</p>

<p>
For Nat could have sworn that through the
gloom there had come a strange sound.  The
sound of a cautioning human voice.  He strained
his ears.  Perhaps there would be a repetition of
the sound.  Yes, there it was again.
</p>

<p>
"Hi-i-i-s-t!"
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" shouted Nat.  "Are you a
man, or am I delirious?"
</p>

<p>
"Donnervetter, I'm a man, all right," came the
response, in a strong foreign accent; "undt up till
lastdt night I voss captain.  Budt who in der
name of der great horn spoons voss you?"
</p>

<p>
"An unfortunate boy whom these rascals have
made a prisoner and whom they are planning to
kill," rejoined Nat, in an agitated voice.
</p>

<p>
"Voss," grunted the other; "dey is making
prisoners of boys on my ship alretty!  By Yupiter,
I see vot I do aboudt dis if ever I get oudt uv
dis scrape."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are in trouble, too?"
</p>

<p>
"You might say I voss in it up by mein ears
alretty," was the doleful response; "but vait, I
strike a light und den vee see each oder more
betterer."
</p>

<p>
A scraping sound followed.  Then came the
sputtering glare of a match and that in turn was
succeeded by the cheerful yellow glow of a
candle.  Oh, how blessed that light seemed to Nat
and how thrice blessed the kindly, weather-beaten
countenance that it illuminated, peering curiously
at the tightly bound boy.
</p>

<p>
"So!" grunted the German gutterally, as his
eyes fell on Nat's plight.  "Der rascals treat you
as badt as dey would have done me if I hadn't
bin too much uv a sharpness fer them.  Vait a
minutes.  I soon fix dose ropes."
</p>

<p>
He drew a big seaman's knife and rapidly
slashed Nat's bonds.  But the boy was so stiffened
that he could hardly stand, even with his
ropes off.
</p>

<p>
"Ach himmel!  Dot is badt," muttered the
other, looking at him concernedly.  "Py der vay,
I dond't tell it to you my name alretty yet.  I vos
Captain Nelsen."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Nelsen!" echoed the boy, in some
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Yah, der captain uv dis schooner before dose
rascals soak me by der headt und take her avay
from me."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are a prisoner, too?"
</p>

<p>
"In a vay, yah; in annudder vay, nein.  You
see, dey is not much goot as navigatiners, dese
loafers, so dey promise to spare my life if I work
der schooner down to der Marquesasas for dem.
Dey go to some island dere.  I don't know yet
yust vot island it vos."
</p>

<p>
"But how came you down here?" asked Nat,
feeling very curious at this surprising turn of
events.
</p>

<p>
For answer the captain raised one fat forefinger
mysteriously.
</p>

<p>
"Hush," he said, "I dink me dot I findt out a
vay to escape alretty."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke a sudden step sounded above them
and the next instant the hatchway was jerked
open by some unseen hand.  Like a flash the
captain puffed out the candle and in considerable
apprehension Nat and his new-found friend
waited in the pitch darkness for whatever was
to come.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
A DESPERATE PLAN.
</h3>

<p>
But it proved to be only a false alarm.  While
Nat's heart beat till it shook his frame and he
crouched back in the shadows and Captain Nelsen
did the same they were not destined to be
discovered that time.  Whoever had raised the hatch
contented himself with peering into the gloomy
hold which, fortunately, was so dark that he
could see nothing.  Presently he slapped the hatch
cover to again, and Nat began to breathe more
freely.
</p>

<p>
"Hum dot vos an escapeness of der narrowness,"
commented the captain.  "I dink me vee
hadt bedder nodt light up der candle vunce more.
Idt might leadt to dere finding us by der inside
mit der hold."
</p>

<p>
Nat agreed with him.
</p>

<p>
"What did you mean when you spoke of
escape just now?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The captain sank his voice to a mysterious
whisper and explained.  As his explanation was
somewhat lengthy, we shall not bother the reader
by rendering it in the captain's dialect, but shall
set it down in plain English as being less tedious.
</p>

<p>
Captain Nelsen then, after informing Nat of
the events leading up to his chartering his schooner
to a party of "scientists en route to the
Marquesas," proceeded to elucidate how he came to be
in the dark hold at such a lucky moment for Nat.
Doubtless, because they felt he was entirely at
their mercy, the invaders of the schooner allowed
him to roam around as he would.  In this way
it had come about that when the captain pleaded
sleepiness he had been allowed to retire to his
cabin in the stern of the schooner without
arousing suspicion in the mind of Morello.
</p>

<p>
But Captain Nelsen's cabin possessed a feature
which, had Morello been aware of it, would
have resulted in the skipper's sleeping quarters
being changed.  This feature was nothing more
or less than a trap-door in the floor.  This
trap-door had formerly led into a specie room; for at
one time the "Nettie Nelsen" had plied in
Alaskan waters and not infrequently valuable
shipments of gold were made on board her.
</p>

<p>
The specie room had, however, been long disused,
and a door fitted in it which led into the
upper hold in which Nat was confined.  Captain
Nelsen therefore no sooner found himself alone
in his cabin than he opened this trap-door,
having first pulled up the strip of carpet which
covered it.  This done he lowered himself into the
specie room and thence emerged into the hold.
</p>

<p>
In doing all this he had, as may be imagined,
an object.  That object was nothing more or less
than a daring plan of escape that had formed
itself in his brain.  Had he not been skipper and
owner of the "Nettie Nelsen" he would never
have thought of such a plan, for it hinged upon
a forgotten feature in the schooner's
construction&mdash;namely, an unused port situated in the
overhang of her stern, and just beneath the main
cabin.
</p>

<p>
This port&mdash;an opening some three feet long by
four wide, had been made when the "Nettie
Nelsen," among her numerous other employments,
had plied in the lumber trade.  It formed a
convenient place to thrust long boards or planks
through direct from the dock alongside which she
might be lying, thus saving the labor of loading
her holds by derricks.  When steamships drove
the "Nettie Nelsen" and her fellow sailing vessels
out of the coasting lumber trade, the port had
been closed.  Several coats of paint now lay over
it on the outside, but inside it was still possible
to remove it and leave a big opening by turning
some screws.
</p>

<p>
The captain had been in the act of investigating
the port when he had heard Nat's despairing
cry, which had alarmed him almost as much as
his exclamation had startled Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Idt vill be dark in a short time now,"
confided the captain, as he concluded; "ven it is
quiet dark I come down again und open der port."
</p>

<p>
"And then what?" asked Nat, his heart pounding
excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"Und den ve eider get avay oder ve gedt in
der soup vorse dan ever," declared the captain.
</p>

<p>
"But how?  We cannot drop through the port
and into the sea," exclaimed Nat.  "Have you got
life belts or something?"
</p>

<p>
"Ach," interrupted the captain impatiently, "I
haf somdings better yet dan dot alretty.  No, by
Yupiter, ven ve go, ve go in style.  Ve go in a
boat."
</p>

<p>
"In a boat!" echoed Nat.  "I must be very
dense, captain, but you'll have to explain this
thing to me some more."
</p>

<p>
"Very veil.  I explins meinself more explicitly
den.  Der ship's boadt hangs on davits over the
stern.  Ven I go py der deck dis evening I yust
careless like dangle down a rope over der taffrail&mdash;dot
is if I gedt it a chance.  Den ven ve open
der port all ve got to do is to vait our chance
undt den reach out for dot rope, swarm up idt
und lower der boat.  Aber den ve lower ourselves,
und by daybreak der schooner be miles avay
undt maybe some steamer or oder vessel bick us
up.  Dot is goodt scheme, yah?"
</p>

<p>
"It sounds all right, captain, but it fairly
bristles with difficulties."
</p>

<p>
"Mein son," admonished the old seaman softly,
"difficulties vos dings made to come over alretty.
Und now, as your limbs are rested, I vill tie you
up again so dot if any one comes down dey
suspect noddings."
</p>

<p>
It was necessary for the captain to light his
candle once more to perform this office.  He did
it with a sailor's celerity, chattering all the while.
</p>

<p>
"Now den," he said, when it was done, "I go
back py my cabins.  Den I votch a chance to drop
dot rope over der rail.  Now keep up a goodt
heart, my poy, for if Got vills it so, ve vill be
oudt of dis craft py midnighds."
</p>

<p>
At these words Nat could have shouted aloud
for joy.  Wild as the captain's scheme would have
appeared to any one in different circumstances, to
the boy&mdash;in his present desperate straits&mdash;it
seemed far better than it had looked at first
blush.  In fact, the more he thought it over, the
more inclined Nat was to think that, with a
measure of reasonably good luck, they might be able to
carry it through.
</p>

<p>
Some time later Hicks alone came below, and
holding up a lantern gave Nat a casual inspection.
It was fortunate that it did not enter his
lazy mind to make it a more thorough one, or he
might have detected that the ropes had been cut
and then reknotted.  But he was in a hurry to get
back to a card game he had been enjoying when
Morello had ordered him below, and after
bestowing a curse on Nat he left once more.
</p>

<p>
"I hope nobody else takes a fancy to come
below and examine me more thoroughly," thought
Nat.  "I wonder how the captain is making out.
If all has gone well, he ought to have carried out
the first part of his program by this time."
</p>

<p>
But it was some hours&mdash;to Nat it appeared
years&mdash;before his newly found friend appeared
once more.  This time he boldly carried a lantern
as he emerged from the doorway of the old specie
room.  He explained this seeming lack of caution
by saying that Morello and Dayton had both
turned in for a heavy drinking bout, and that
most of the crew were befuddled also.
</p>

<p>
"Dere iss only der man by der helm to look
out for, und I guess ve can take care of him,"
he said, as, for the second time, he loosed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Nat, as he stood free, "what
next?"
</p>

<p>
Captain Nelsen produced a wrench.  It was
only a small one&mdash;a nickled bicycle tool, in fact&mdash;but
he said that it would do to unfasten the bolts
of the port through which they were to creep on
their perilous attempt.
</p>

<p>
It was hard work getting the bolts loose with
the small tool.  But at last it was accomplished.
Nat with difficulty stifled a whoop of pure joy
as, the last bolt having been removed, they
cautiously worked the port out of its place and,
through the opening thus revealed, they saw the
stars shining softly above the vast, lonely Pacific.
</p>

<p>
"Aber, so far so goodt," breathed the captain.
He reached out, and after some feeling about
grasped a dangling rope.  It was the one he had
found an opportunity to drop down earlier in the
night.  Dragging it inside the port, he turned to
Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Der next step you vill haf to dake," he said,
almost in an apologetic tone.  "I am nodt so
young as I vos vunce, und I'm afraid dot I make
some noise mit my stiff old joints ven I go
climbing abodt."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I'll go up after the boat," said Nat
hastily, "but first tell me is the steersman near
to the helm?"
</p>

<p>
"No, der veel of der 'Nettie Nelsen' is quiet
a distance from der tiller," said Captain Nelsen.
"I hadt it built dot vay pecose mit der veel over
der tiller she steered badly.  If you haf luck, der
helmsman vill nodt see you."
</p>

<p>
As there was no use hesitating any longer Nat
grasped the rope.  First, however, he removed
his shoes and stockings.  This was both for
greater ease in climbing and also so that he would
not make any more noise than was necessary.
</p>

<p>
"Well, here goes," he said, as with the rope
in his hands he reached the edge of the opening
and prepared to wriggle through.  But the
captain stopped him.  The old seaman held out his
right hand.  Nat, perceiving what he meant,
clasped it in a fervent grip.
</p>

<p>
"Got pless you," said the captain, with some
emotion in his gruff tones.  "You are a prave
poy."
</p>

<p>
The next instant Nat was through the open
port, the captain extinguishing the lantern as the
lad vanished.
</p>

<p>
Nat was a good and an active climber, but to
climb a rope in a "gym" is quite a different
matter to ascending one when it is dangling loosely
from the stern of a plunging schooner ploughing
her way briskly over a heaving sea under a smart
breeze.
</p>

<p>
As his body came on the cable Nat was swung
about like the weight on a pendulum.  Below him
boiled the white wake of the "Nettie Nelsen."  Mustering
every ounce of his strength, he began
to ascend the rope.  But the task was the hardest
he had ever tackled.  Swung dizzily hither and
thither through space, the boy's brain reeled and
spun.  But he stuck to it pluckily and by dint of
sheer hard, gritty work he at length managed to
clamber as high as the break of the stern, and
attain the level of the stern cabin windows.
</p>

<p>
But as he reached it something happened which
came very nearly terminating the night's
adventure then and there.  A sudden lurch of the
schooner, coming as Nat reached for the solid,
wooden stern works, flung him violently
outward at the end of the rope.  For one instant
he impended dizzily above the gleaming white
wake of the vessel.  The next he was dashed with
stunning violence toward the stern.
</p>

<p>
As he was swung inward with terrific velocity
Nat, more by instinct than anything else, let go
with one hand and held the released member out
in front of him with the idea of breaking the
impact of the blow against the "Nettie Nelsen's"
stern.
</p>

<p>
But instead of striking solid wood, his fist, to
his surprise, encountered something yielding&mdash;the
shade of the open cabin port, in fact.  Before
Nat could quite realize what had occurred he
heard a deafening crash within the cabin itself
as some glass or chinaware, which had been
standing in the open port, was knocked to the
floor when his fist struck the shade.
</p>

<p>
At the same instant from within the cabin came
an angry shout:
</p>

<p>
"What in the name of old Harry was that?"
</p>

<p>
Nat hastily dropped some distance down his
rope as he heard footsteps crossing the cabin
floor.  Evidently, whoever had uttered the shout,
meant to investigate the cause of the accident.
The shade was pushed aside and Nat saw a head
thrust out.  His discovery appeared inevitable.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
HOW IT WORKED OUT.
</h3>

<p>
What with the stunning effect of the blow he
had received as he was swung against the schooner's
stern works and the shock of the accident
which had followed, Nat's senses almost left him
for an instant.  Like one in a dream he hung
there, just under the swell of the vessel's counter
and listened to the voices above him.  They were
Colonel Morello's and Ed. Dayton's.
</p>

<p>
"What in the name of Beelzebub was it?" he
heard Dayton's harsh voice inquiring.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I could have sworn for an
instant that I saw the flash of a hand through the
window," growled out Morello&mdash;evidently from
the nearness of the sound he still had his head
outside the cabin port.
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  How could that be?" scoffed Dayton
from within, "unless the schooner is haunted.  It
must have been the last lurch she gave."
</p>

<p>
"That must have been it," agreed Morello,
withdrawing his head, "but, at any rate, our
supply of liquor was knocked off that shelf and the
bottle broken.  What do you say if we go
forward and get some more?"
</p>

<p>
"The very thing," Nat could hear Dayton reply.
The next instant he heard the slam of a door
float through the open port above him and knew
that the cabin must be empty.
</p>

<p>
Now was his time to act then, and fortunately
for him, with his returning senses there had
come a slight lull in the wind.  The schooner was
steadier, and by dint of pressing his knees
against her structure when he climbed above the
overhang of the stern he managed to ascend at a
famous rate.
</p>

<p>
All at once he found himself opposite the cabin
window once more.  The blind or shade that his
unlucky swing had knocked aside was now open,
however, and he could plainly see the interior of
the place.  His curiosity quite overcame his
prudence, as, steadying himself by pressing his feet
into some scroll work contrived about the vessel's
name on the stern, he gazed eagerly into the
apartment which was lighted by a powerful
hanging lamp.
</p>

<p>
But hardly had his eyes taken in the details
of the place and observed that it was empty,
Dayton and Morello having both departed to replenish
the spirit bottle, before his eyes lit on something
that made him start and hold his breath.
In plain view within and right below the cabin
window was the sapphire chest.
</p>

<p>
From his position Nat could almost by an
effort have reached within and touched it.  The
sight of the plundered box raised within him a
strange feeling of anger against the rascals who
had stolen it.  All fear seemed to drop from him
like a garment.  As he gazed one of those
strange accessions of desperate resolve which
come sometimes in moments of intense peril
visited him.
</p>

<p>
"Why would it not be possible to regain the
box, and, in the event of their plan being successfully
carried out, take it with them in the boat?"
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Nat that hardly had the idea
flashed into his mind before, impelled by some
strange, irresistible resolve, he was within the
cabin, having scrambled through the port,
dragging his rope in with him.  Barefooted as he
was, he made no more noise than a panther
tracking its game.
</p>

<p>
In the same noiseless manner in which he had
entered the place he glided across the carpeted
floor to the door leading on to the deck, by means
of a companionway.  Within it was a heavy bolt
and massive chain, relics no doubt of the same
epoch that had witnessed the construction of the
specie room.  It was the work of an instant to
slip the bolt into place and then adjust the chain.
This done, the lad was secure from interruption
for a few moments at any rate.  Even if he could
not accomplish the feat of transferring the chest
to the boat he could at least carry out a desperate
resolve he had formed.  This was no less than at
all hazards to deprive the rascals of the benefits
they had filched.  Nat had determined that if
he were discovered before he had had time to
complete his work that he would heave the chest
through the port and into the sea, thus losing the
sapphire hoard to Morello and his men for all
time.
</p>

<p>
But Nat had high hopes that he would have
time to put through the plan of escape as he and
Captain Nelsen had planned it out together.
Slipping back across the cabin floor, he took the
end of his rope and made a double half hitch
around the chest, which, to his surprise, was not
nearly as heavy as he had imagined it would be.
This, however, he attributed to his excitement.
</p>

<p>
He had just completed this work and was about
to heave the chest, with the rope attached, out of
the port when something happened that seemed to
drive every drop of blood in his body into his
heart and then send it racing in a mad torrent
through his veins.
</p>

<p>
Click!
</p>

<p>
This was the sound that had made Nat glance
up from his work in time to behold one of the
stateroom doors that opened off the cabin
swinging ajar.
</p>

<p>
The next instant it was opened fully and the
huge form of Swensen, the giant Swede, stalked
out.
</p>

<p>
Nat was motionless as a frightened rabbit.  In
the dreadful crisis he was temporarily deprived
of the power of crying out or moving.
</p>

<p>
Swensen's eyes fixed themselves on the boy
with a peculiar expression, and in his bare
feet&mdash;for he was in his night clothes&mdash;he began to
advance toward him.  Closer and closer he came
and still Nat stood, held by a dreadful spell that
bound his limbs and fettered his tongue&mdash;not
indeed that it would have done him any good to
have cried out.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly&mdash;just as suddenly as he had
appeared&mdash;Swensen turned and in the same slow,
deliberate way started back toward his cabin.
It was then that Nat noted something that in his
alarm he had not seen before.
</p>

<p>
The man was asleep!
</p>

<p>
He had walked out of his cabin in a fit of
somnambulism, or sleep-walking, and now he
reentered it again and doubtless climbed back into
his bunk.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had his immense bony form vanished
and the door clicked to behind him once more
before Nat had the chest out of the port and then
when it swung at the end of the rope, dropping
like the weight on a plumb line, he followed it.
</p>

<p>
His rope was now much easier to climb, for it
was steadied by the weight of the chest at its
lower end.  The length of the line was sufficient
to allow the chest to dangle within a foot or two
of the water.
</p>

<p>
With renewed courage Nat swarmed on up
the rope and presently was able to poke his head
over the taffrail.  As Captain Nelsen had said,
the helmsman, by reason of the peculiar steering
device of the "Nettie Nelsen," was some little
distance from the stern, forming an additional
protection in the work that lay before him.
Between Nat and the man at the wheel there was a
big pile of canvas and boxes, apparently left
there by some of the gang after they had
ransacked the schooner.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, Nat managed to clamber up into
the boat, which hung out on her davits, without
attracting any attention from the man.  Once in
the boat, the lad took a swift look about him.  At
the helm was the steersman, a soft light thrown
up on his rugged features from the binnacle.
From forward some stentorian voice was roaring
out a chorus.  Nat devoutly hoped that the noise
might keep up, for it was not to be supposed
that he could lower the boat in absolute quietness.
</p>

<p>
All at once something happened that sent him
crouching down in the bottom of the dingy.
Morello and Dayton suddenly appeared on the
stern.  The former addressed the helmsman.
</p>

<p>
"We're in for some bad weather, Larsen.
You'll have to stand an extra trick at the wheel,
for all hands will be needed on the sails."
</p>

<p>
As he listened, Nat noticed what in his
excitement he had hitherto overlooked.  A remarkable
change had come over the night.  The stars were
blotted out and the wind had fallen till it was
almost a dead calm.  In the lull the schooner rolled
heavily, her sails flapping and her blocks cracking
complainingly.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly off to the west a vivid red streak
split the sky.  It was followed after an interval
by the heavy booming of thunder.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go below and call Swensen," Nat heard
Dayton say.
</p>

<p>
The boy's pulses bounded.  If Dayton carried
out this resolve, it meant that he would discover
that the cabin door was locked on the inside and
suspicion would instantly be aroused.  In the
search which would certainly follow he would be
discovered, and also Captain Nelsen.  What their
fate would be in such a case Nat dared not think.
</p>

<p>
But fortunately Colonel Morello vetoed this
proposal.
</p>

<p>
"Let him have his sleep out," he said; "the
storm won't be on us for some time yet, and
Hicks can take care of the work of shortening
sail."
</p>

<p>
"Well, how about that old sea horse, Captain
Nelsen?" were the next words of Dayton.  Nat's
heart fairly stood still for an instant and then
gave a terrified bound as Colonel Morello
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"By Beelzebub, I had forgotten him.  Go below
and rout him out."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
ADRIFT IN THE PACIFIC.
</h3>

<p>
But hardly had Dayton started on the errand
which would have spelled disaster to the hopes of
Nat and his friend when something happened
that, for the time being at least, put all other
thoughts out of their heads.
</p>

<p>
There was a sharp warning shout from forward,
followed by a splitting, tearing sound.
</p>

<p>
The schooner heeled sharply, throwing Nat the
length of the boat in which he was concealed.  A
sharp puff of wind&mdash;hot as if from an opened
oven door&mdash;swept over the sea and passed on.
It left the air motionless as before, but it had
stripped the schooner of her headsails as Nat
could make out by the shouts and cries on her
decks.
</p>

<p>
Utterly forgetting his duty in the emergency&mdash;indeed
in the dead calm which had followed he
was not of any particular use at the wheel&mdash;the
helmsman followed Colonel Morello and Dayton
as they bounded forward.
</p>

<p>
The moment to act had arrived.  Rapidly Nat
cast off the falls, belaying them around a cleat.
Then he paid out on them and the boat dropped
rapidly and noiselessly to the water.  A moment
later Captain Nelsen, who had been on the lookout,
reached out for the dangling rope to the end
of which the sapphire chest was attached.  He
caught it and slid into the boat with the dexterity
of a seaman.
</p>

<p>
"Great Bull Whales, lad," he exclaimed as he
landed in the little craft, "voss vos keeping you
such a dime?  You haf hadt me scared by mein
death aind't idt.  I dought me sure dot dey had
caught you."
</p>

<p>
"What kept me, captain?" repeated Nat, in a
breathless voice.  "Just this."
</p>

<p>
He indicated the sapphire chest dangling just
above them.
</p>

<p>
"Donnerblitzen, boy, vos iss dot?  Provisions?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  It's the sapphire chest I told you
about.  The one that these scamps robbed me of."
</p>

<p>
"Ach himmel, undt you gedt it back.  Poy, you
iss a vounder, aind't idt?  Budt don't told it to
me aboudt it now alretty.  Ledt me hear it later.
Vee haf no time to lose."
</p>

<p>
Reaching up Nat cut the rope that held the
chest suspended and exerting his strength
lowered it into the boat.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, we're ready," he said, getting out
the oars.  "I think&mdash;hark!"
</p>

<p>
From the cabin port above them there came a
roar&mdash;a bull-like bellow of rage.  It was Swensen's
voice.  Evidently he had just awakened and
discovered that the chest had vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Morello!  Dayton!" they could hear him
thunder out.  "Der chest!  Der chest bane gone!"
</p>

<p>
"Undt it's time dot vee bane gone, too," echoed
Captain Nelsen.  "Gif vay mit dose oars, ladt."
</p>

<p>
"Which way shall I pull, captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Any place avay from der schooner.  Pretty
soon dis be like vun hornets' nest, alretty yet."
</p>

<p>
Nat needed no urging, and began to propel
the boat in a direction which was easterly,
although he took no particular account of it.  The
sea hardly heaved and it had grown blisteringly
hot.  The schooner as they left her was
wallowing in the heavy swell like a dead whale.
</p>

<p>
"Py Yupiter, dere go der firevorks," exclaimed
Captain Nelsen, as more and more water showed
between the schooner and the boat.
</p>

<p>
He was right; there were "fireworks" on board
the "Nettie Nelsen."  Swensen had burst from
the cabin, first undoing the locks and bolts like
an infuriated bull.  It had not taken him long to
communicate his tidings to Morello and Dayton.
The discovery that the boat had gone almost
instantly followed, giving those on board an easy
clue as to how their prisoners had escaped.
</p>

<p>
"Shoudt avay!  Shoudt avay!" grinned Captain
Nelsen to himself.  "Vee godt der only boat
on board der 'Nettie Nelsen,' undt if you vant
us, you got to schwim for us, by Yupiter!"
</p>

<p>
This was true.  In the dead calm which
prevailed it was obviously impossible to work the
schooner even had her headsails not been in such
sad disorder.  But if they reckoned on getting off
scot free, the two adventurers in the boat were
sadly mistaken.
</p>

<p>
All at once the sea was illuminated with a
glare as red as blood.  The sudden flare came
from the schooner's stern, where, by Morello's
orders, a Coston light had been ignited.  Nat had
just time to see several figures with leveled rifles
peering about for a sight of the boat when a
bullet came singing by him.  Another and another
followed.  But not one hit.  Then the light died
down and darkness fell once more.
</p>

<p>
Across the water they could hear voices on
board the schooner distinctly.
</p>

<p>
"We'll never hit them by this kind of light,"
Dayton could be heard saying.
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" came Morello's response; "don't aim
for them&mdash;aim for the boat and aim to sink it!"
</p>

<p>
Before either Nat or the captain had time to
digest this alarming order another light flared
up.  Evidently the rascals had ransacked the
locker in which the schooner's signaling apparatus
was kept.  This time it was a weird blue light
that spread out upon the blackness of the night.
</p>

<p>
Following Morello's advice, the marksmen
were now aiming for the boat itself.  The bullets
pattered like hail on the water about them.
Suddenly there was a ripping sound and a shower of
splinters flew about Nat, who was laboring
gallantly at the oars.
</p>

<p>
"Apove der vater line," announced Captain
Nelsen calmly.  In the glare cast by the light
the white wound on the gunwale of the boat could
be seen distinctly.
</p>

<p>
"But it shows that they have our range,"
commented Nat.  "The next one will do more
damage."
</p>

<p>
The boy was right.
</p>

<p>
After a dozen more bullets had pattered about
them, two missiles simultaneously pierced the side
of the boat below the water line.  The sea began
to squirt in in two little fountains.  But Captain
Nelsen was prepared for just such an emergency.
Pulling out his immense red bandanna handkerchief,
he tore it into strips and plugged the holes.
</p>

<p>
A few seconds later the glare died down, and
they were safe for the time being.  Nat rowed
desperately to get out of range before those on
board the schooner could light another flare.
</p>

<p>
Whether he would have succeeded in this
purpose, however, is destined not to be known.
Hardly had the blue flare died out before the
night was illuminated with an even more ghastly
radiance.  The lightning began a regular witch-dance
to the westward of the schooner and the
boat.  It patterned the night sky like a bit of fine
lacework.
</p>

<p>
It was well that they had that light by which
to see and prepare for the peril that now menaced
them.  As it was, however, Captain Nelsen had
barely time to shout a warning before another
puff of the same hot wind as had assailed the
schooner blew sharply over them.  At the same
instant Nat, looking up, espied coming toward the
boat at a terrific pace what appeared to be a
mountainous wall of white water.  It roared as
it came like a mighty waterfall.
</p>

<p>
All this, however, they had little time to note
before they were in the midst of the vortex of
water.  By sheer instinct Nat dropped his oars
and clung to a thwart as the wave rushed down
on them.  The next instant he felt him himself
borne down by a crushing weight of water.  The
breath was fairly jammed out of his body, while
tons of green water seemed to be above, about,
and on every side of him.
</p>

<p>
At last, sputtering and gasping, he emerged
into air again.  But things were not as they
had been before the passing of the mighty wave.
The boat was now full of water to her gunwales
and had she not been fitted with air chambers
would inevitably have gone to the bottom.  Nat
was immensely relieved to hear the captain's
voice beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Yumping Yupiter!" gasped that doughty mariner,
clinging to the side of the submerged craft,
"dot must haf been der daddy of all der vaves.
Undt now look oudt for here comes der vind."
</p>

<p>
Hardly had he spoken before the sea was
lashed into sudden fury.  In the darkness they
could see the white caps all about them.
Horrified at this new calamity, Nat managed to shout
out:
</p>

<p>
"Will the boat float?"
</p>

<p>
"Till der lasdt oldt cadt iss deadt," the captain
assured him, in a hoarse shout; "as long as
we can hold on we are all right."
</p>

<p>
"But we can't hold on indefinitely," objected
Nat.  "How long do you think this storm will
last?"
</p>

<p>
"It is one of dose Basific storms," rejoined the
captain, "dot don't last so very long.  Maype dis
be all over in an hour or so."
</p>

<p>
Fervently hoping that the captain might be correct,
Nat took a firmer grip on the gunwale.  The
boat, thanks to her air chambers, rode buoyantly
enough, and if they could but retain their grip
of her they were in no great actual peril of
drowning.  But even if they rode out the storm,
there was the question of food to be
considered&mdash;and water, too.  Truly their predicament
seemed wretched.  But desperate as it appeared,
Nat found his thoughts wandering to the
sapphire chest he had risked so much to recover.
Was it still in the boat, or had it been washed
overboard when the storm wave overwhelmed
them?
</p>

<p>
The lad was still cogitating this question when
a shout from the captain startled him.  He
glanced up on the tossing and wind-torn sea and
saw a strange sight.
</p>

<p>
Coming toward them on a tack that would
bring her quite close to them was the schooner.
</p>

<p>
Even under half-bare poles as she was she
seemed to be flying over the yeasty, tempest-torn
seas.  On and on she came, seeming to Nat's
excited imagination, to be a hunted creature,
pursued by the vengeance of the storm.  It was as if
nature, aroused by the misdeeds of the rascally
crew the "Nettie Nelsen" now carried, was
riding her down with the hounds of the wind and
tempest.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE TIGERS OF THE SEA.
</h3>

<p>
The storm-driven schooner drove past the
swamped boat, with its two castaways clinging
to it, in a smother of foam and spray.  So fast
was she traveling that hardly had her outlines
loomed up before they were lost again in the
darkness.  Nat caught himself wondering if that
night was to prove the last of the schooner's
existence.  But it may be stated here that the
"Nettie Nelsen," staunch sea boat that she was,
weathered the storm unharmed.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
The storm-driven schooner drove past the swamped boat, <br />
with its two castaways clinging to it.
</p>

<p>
"Vell, here iss der vorst fix I voss ever in since
I bin going py der sea."
</p>

<p>
It was Captain Nelsen who spoke, as a pallid
and wild dawn broke over the raging sea, showing
nothing but tossing whitecaps as far as the
eye could reach.  Overhead great torn ribbands
of cloud were hurried by, their black outlines
macerated by the wind which was still blowing
hard.  But rough as the sea still was and strong
as the wind remained, there was no doubt that
the fury of the gale was over.  In a short time
it would have blown itself out.
</p>

<p>
This was encouraging to the castaways, but
even with calm seas their position would still
have been a desperate one.  Adrift on the trackless
Pacific, without food or fresh water, and so
far as they knew, far from the line of travel of
ships, the man and the boy clinging to the
waterlogged boat were in about as bad a fix as can
be imagined.
</p>

<p>
Nat, too, strong as he was, began to feel the
strain.  The long period he had gone without
food, for he had tasted nothing since the meal
which Hicks and Britt had brought him, was
beginning to tell on him.  Captain Nelsen's iron
frame, however, inured to hardship and peril,
was as vigorous as ever, or so it seemed.
</p>

<p>
As the wind began to moderate he cast his eyes
about for something with which they might bale
out the "Nettie Nelsen's" boat.  He was
particularly anxious to get this task accomplished in
order that they might have a sanctuary from
danger which had just occurred to him.  The thought
of this new peril actually blanched the captain's
weather-beaten cheeks, but a quick glance at
Nat's worn countenance, white and lined with
anxiety, told him that he had better not add to
the strain on the lad by mentioning what had just
crossed his mind.
</p>

<p>
The water was warm, fortunately, but even so
Nat began to feel chilled and cold.  This was
partly due to the fact that he had taken no
nourishment for so long a period.  It was a symptom
of exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
At length the sun rose, and as his rays gilded
the tossing seas the wind began to die down till
within a short time all trace of the storm had
vanished.  The sea grew smooth and the air hot.
Captain Nelsen's first impulse was to look about
for a sign of the "Nettie Nelsen," but not a trace
of her was to be seen.  She had vanished as
utterly as the storm before which she was driving
when they saw her last.
</p>

<p>
"Vell, dere vos some comfort in dot, anyhow,"
said the captain to himself; "dose murdering
thieves von't get us even if der sharks&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The sharks!
</p>

<p>
That was the peril of which Captain Nelsen
had refrained speaking to Nat.  As the above
reflection crossed his mind, the honest German's
eyes almost popped out of his head at the sight
of something he perceived not far from the boat,
moving aimlessly about on the now smooth water.
</p>

<p>
The object was a black triangular fin!
</p>

<p>
As he gazed it was joined by another and yet
another, till there were six in all.
</p>

<p>
But at almost the same instant as the captain
had sighted the sharks, Nat, who had been gazing
down into the water which filled the boat in the
hope of getting something to bale with, gave a
cry of joy.  In the bow, wedged in under a
triangular brace, was a baling can belonging to the
craft.  And what to his eyes was almost as
welcome a sight, farther back in the little craft and
beneath a seat which had doubtless prevented it
being washed overboard, was the sapphire chest.
Nat's drooping spirits were considerably revived
by these two discoveries, and he greeted the captain,
who had looked up at the lad's cry of delight,
with a feeble cheer.
</p>

<p>
"Hooray, captain!  Never say die!  With that
can we'll have the boat baled out before long
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stopped short as he caught sight of the
seaman's doleful expression.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" he asked.  "True, we
are not out of troubles yet, but with a good boat
under us."
</p>

<p>
"Dot iss idt," returned the captain from his
side of the boat.  "How voss vee to get der boat
under us?"
</p>

<p>
"Bale her out, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Budt she is now on a lefel mit der vater.  Vot
is der use of baling.  As fast as vee bale out der
Bacifig he come in."
</p>

<p>
"By George, that's so," agreed Nat, immensely
crestfallen; "but see here," he went on, with a
sudden flash of inspiration, "it's only our weight
that keeps her level with the water.  Yours
particularly.  Why can't we let go for a few
seconds and swim at the stern while I bale out a
few canfuls?"
</p>

<p>
"Dot vould be a goot idee if idt vossn't for
vun ding," rejoined the captain, with a wry face.
</p>

<p>
"And that is?"
</p>

<p>
"Sharks!"
</p>

<p>
Nat shuddered as he heard the dread word.
</p>

<p>
"Sharks!  Where?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Here, there, undt everyveres," rejoined the German.
</p>

<p>
And now Nat saw what, but for his search for
a baling can, he would have perceived earlier, and
that was that the water about the boat was by
this time fairly alive with the sea tigers.  His
heart sank with alarm and despondency.  It
seemed hard to be spared during the rigors of
the storm only to meet this new and deadly danger.
</p>

<p>
"What are we to do, captain?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know alretty," came the frank
response.  "Der only ding I can dink off is to get
into der boat."
</p>

<p>
"Won't she sink?"
</p>

<p>
"No der air chambers will buoy her oop, budt
at dot vee shan't be mooch bedder off."
</p>

<p>
"That's true," agreed Nat ruefully, "but in
any event we shall be partially protected."
</p>

<p>
Acting on this idea, they clambered painfully
into the boat; their limbs, however, were so stiff
and cramped from their long immersion that this
was a slow and tedious process.
</p>

<p>
It was accomplished at length, though, but
their weight in the craft sank her even lower
in the water so that they were almost waist deep
in the sea as they clung to the thwarts.
</p>

<p>
The sharks had grown bolder, too, now.  All
about them they could see the flash of greeny-white
bodies as the sea monsters slowly circled
the boat, as if making up their minds from which
side to attack it first.
</p>

<p>
"Beadt on der vater mit your hands," counselled
the German.  "Dose sharks iss pig cowards
undt maype vee scare dem off for a vile."
</p>

<p>
Nat beat his hands furiously on the water,
churning it into foam, and, as Captain Nelsen
had predicted, the sharks&mdash;even the boldest of
them&mdash;sheered off.  But it was only for a short
time.  They presently reappeared and seemed to
be bolder than before.
</p>

<p>
Nat gazed at them with frank alarm, and
Captain Nelsen was scarcely less perturbed.
Although they both beat on the water now and
made all the noise they could, the sharks seemed
to be growing less and less afraid of them.  Nat
could almost see a contemptuous gleam in the
creatures' piggy little eyes as they swam round
the boat.
</p>

<p>
All at once one of them, seeming to tire of this
aimless circling, made a sudden dash at the craft.
Nat fairly shouted with alarm and perhaps his
cry scared the creature off.  At any rate, they
were saved for that time, but it grew very evident
that before long a moment would arrive when
they could no longer hold the creatures at bay.
</p>

<p>
It was just then that the captain gave a shout.
</p>

<p>
"Idiotcy dot I voss," he yelled, so that Nat
thought he had lost his mind under the stress of
their situation; "idiotcy dot I voss.  Dere is
somedings in dis very boadt dot vill drive dose
fellows avay."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" demanded the astonished Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Dot der last time dis boat vos used vos ven
ve vos painting der ship sides.  Ve didt not finish
der chob before ve had to sail, undt a big can of
acid vot vee use for cleaning off der oldt paint
vos put in dot stern locker."
</p>

<p>
"In that box under the seat?" asked Nat
excitedly, half guessing what the captain was
driving at.
</p>

<p>
"Yah.  Of you can reach it and der can is still
dere, ve soon get ridt of der sharks.  Ve poison
der sea, by Yupiter."
</p>

<p>
"By pouring the acid into it!" cried Nat
enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
As he was the nearest to the stern of the submerged
boat, it fell to him to open the locker and
there, sure enough, was a big ten-gallon can of
caustic acid.  The boy dragged it out and
extracted the cork.  The pungent liquid was then
poured on the waters about the boat.
</p>

<p>
Instantly the sea in the vicinity turned white
as milk and they could see the sharks' bodies
flash as they fled before the poisonous impregnation
of the waters.
</p>

<p>
"Hooray!" shouted Nat, forgetting that even
with the sharks gone they were almost in the
same position as before, so far as hopelessness
was concerned.
</p>

<p>
Almost at once, however, the realization
overcame him.  Adrift on the broad ocean, immersed
to their waists in a sodden boat, what hope had
they of rescue.  In the extremity of his despair
Nat groaned aloud.  But his doleful exclamation
was interrupted by the captain.  That individual,
who had been raising himself as high as he dared
in the boat and gazing about over the sunlit,
desolate waters, gave a sudden guttural shout, that
was almost a scream:
</p>

<p>
"Look!  Look!" he shouted, pointing.  "Py
yiminy, dere's a ship or I'm vun Dutchman!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
TRICKED!
</h3>

<p>
Hardly willing to believe his ears lest the strain
of disappointment should be too much for him
in case the captain proved to be mistaken, Nat
followed the direction of the excited mariner's
pointing hand.
</p>

<p>
It was only by a severe effort of control that
Nat saved himself from a collapse as he saw
that it was not a case of a shipwrecked man's
optical delusions.
</p>

<p>
Coming toward them from the eastern horizon
was a craft of some sort.  But she was,
as yet, too far off to be made out as anything
but a moving object.  As she grew closer, however,
it could be seen that she was without sails
or funnel, and quite a small craft to be so far out
at sea.
</p>

<p>
Nat, taking all this in with burning eyes, was
struck at the same time by something strangely
familiar about the craft.  As she came on, doubt
deepened into certainty.  In a voice that shook
under his effort to render it steady, Nat gave an
amazed shout:
</p>

<p>
"The 'Nomad,' by all that's wonderful!"
</p>

<p>
"But will she see us?"  This thought came on
the top of his first glad recognition of the
approaching craft.  It was evident now that her
course would bring the "Nomad"&mdash;or the vessel
that Nat was sure he had recognized as her&mdash;past
the castaways at some distance from them.
They had no means of signaling and could not
attract the attention of those on board.  If, by
any chance, she should go by without seeing
them, Nat believed he should go mad.  But to his
joy as he and the captain in their half-sunken
boat waved as hard as they dared, without
disturbing the equilibrium of their craft, there came
a puff of smoke and a sharp report from the
bridge of the motor boat, where three figures
could be seen.
</p>

<p>
It was a signal that they had been seen!
</p>

<p>
The "Nomad's" course was changed and she
began to cut through the water directly for them,
although of the surprise in store for them none
of those on board Nat's craft was aware.
</p>

<p>
"Hoch der Kaiser, Nat!" shouted Captain Nelsen,
in tremendous excitement.  "Vee are safed,
my poy!  Vee are safed!"
</p>

<p>
"Donnerblitzen!" he exclaimed the next instant,
for Nat, after breaking into a queer, trembly
sort of smile and attempting to say something,
had pitched forward, face down, in the
water.  For the first and last time in his life the
overwrought boy had fainted.
</p>

<p>
Captain Nelsen reached forward his bulky
form to pick Nat up, but as he did so, in the stress
of the moment, he quite forgot the treacherous
footing beneath him.  His sudden movement
caused the boat to lurch and in an instant he and
Nat were struggling in the water&mdash;or rather it
was the captain who was struggling, holding in
his arms the inert form of the unconscious boy.
</p>

<p>
But luckily help was right at hand.
</p>

<p>
"Catch a line!" came a voice from above, as
the "Nomad" swept down on the two in the
water.
</p>

<p>
At the same instant a rope with a running
noose in it snaked through the air, thrown by
Joe Hartley, at whose side was Ding-dong Bell,
while Cal was close beside them.  It was Joe,
whose trick at the wheel it was, who had first
sighted the drifting, submerged boat.  How the
Motor Rangers came to be in that part of the
Pacific will be explained before long.
</p>

<p>
Captain Nelsen deftly caught the rope as Joe
rang the engine room bell for "stop-reverse."
</p>

<p>
The captain was, of course, a total stranger
to the boys and to Cal, and who the bedraggled
boy might be whom he held in his arms they had
no idea.  All at once, however, as the captain
adjusted the line about the boy's body, Nat's face
was visible.
</p>

<p>
"It's Nat Trevor!" shrieked Ding-dong Bell,
his hesitating English, as usual, leaving him
under the stress of the moment.
</p>

<p>
"So it is.  Great heavens, what can he be doing
here!" gasped Joe, his face a study in amazement
and delight if ever there was one.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, we've found him, lads," said Cal,
reverently removing his sombrero, which he still
insisted on wearing, even on board the "Nomad."
</p>

<p>
In less time than it takes to tell it both the
captain and Nat were on board the gallant little
motor craft, while an amazed ship's company
gathered about them, all trying to talk at once.
Captain Akers, who, after battling with the storm
the night before, had been taking a nap below,
was aroused by the hub-bub, and came on deck,
and so did Sam Hinckley, who had been at the
engines.  So engrossed was everybody that the
"Nomad," with her engines still reversed, was
allowed to drift backward at her own sweet will.
</p>

<p>
The extraordinary recovery of the boy they
believed to be either drowned, or in the hands of
their relentless foes, temporarily deprived all
hands of the power to do anything except
exchange thunderstruck looks and exclamations.
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers lost no time, after the first
stunning shock of amazement had passed, in getting
some restoratives from the medicine chest in the
cabin.  In the meantime, Sam Hinckley had
recollected his duty and, diving swiftly below to his
engines, had checked their retrograde movement.
Therefore, till new sailing orders came, the
"Nomad" lay motionless on the long swells, while they
all clustered about Nat on the bridge.
</p>

<p>
As for Captain Nelsen, his rugged constitution
speedily rallied from the ordeal through
which he and the lad had passed, and thanks to
the influence of Captain Akers' remedies it was
not long before Nat, too, was sitting up alert and
in full possession of his faculties.
</p>

<p>
Then came his story.  With what enrapt
attention it was heard may be better imagined by
each reader than set down in cold type.  The
extraordinary tale thrilled them as had few
happenings in their adventurous lives.
</p>

<p>
At length, after such numerous interruptions
as you may imagine, Nat concluded his strange
tale.  Then came the question of what to do.
Clearly the schooner was bound for some island
in the Marquesas Group&mdash;but just what spot of
land was a question.
</p>

<p>
The only clew lay in Hicks's reference to the
island of "Oh-dear-me."  It was Captain Nelsen
who solved the difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"Dot 'oh dear me' can be no odder island dan
Odahmi," he said.  "I know the place veil."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of a place is it?" asked Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Vell idt iss vun off der more remote islands
of der group, undt ven I vos dere many years
ago in a valer der vos nobody liffing on idt budt
some natives."
</p>

<p>
"Then it is just the sort of place that Morello
and his band would seek out," declared Joe.
"They could lie snugly hid there for as long as
they liked and emerge into the world at some
distant date in comparative safety."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if it wasn't for one thing," put in
Captain Akers.  "And that is that we happen to
know their destination and can inform the
authorities of it."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," agreed Nat, "but in the meantime
you haven't yet told us how you came to happen
along so opportunely."
</p>

<p>
"That is easily told, Nat, and after your
narrative will seem very tame," rejoined Joe.  "It
appears, then, that while Sam was asleep on
board, those rascals, knowing that the 'Nomad'
was a menace to them, cut her cable and set her
adrift on the outgoing tide.  When Sam awoke he
was miles down the coast.  He lost no time in
navigating back, much mystified in the meantime
as to what could have happened to set him adrift.
Of course, as soon as he had met us and we all
compared notes and examined the cut end of the
cable, it was as clear as day.  With the 'Nomad'
once more in our possession, we decided to set
out at once in search of you, hoping that by hook
or crook when the schooner struck the boat
you had managed to save yourself.  By good luck,
after weathering that terrific gale last night, we
ran across you this morning, but it was a close
shave I can tell you, for you formed so
inconspicuous an object on the ocean that we came
near missing you."
</p>

<p>
"Ach himmel!" exclaimed Captain Nelsen.
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Nat, with a smile, "as I see
that Sam Hinckley has secured the boat to the
'Nomad' with a line, I will ask him to pull her in
alongside.  I've got something on board there
that will interest you all."
</p>

<p>
Nat had purposely thus held back the news of
the recovery of the treasure chest so as to give
his companions a real surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Wh-h-h-h-hat can it be?" wondered Ding-dong.
</p>

<p>
"You'll soon see," said Nat, with a smile.
"Now then," as Sam Hinckley drew the half-sunken
boat alongside, "just oblige me by looking
down into that boat and telling me what you see
under the middle seat."
</p>

<p>
He paused with twinkling eyes and the air of
a conjurer.  The others eagerly enough lined up
at the bridge rail and peered down overside.
The interior of the boat was visible, as if seen
through glass in the translucent water.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Nat smilingly, after a moment.
</p>

<p>
Joe drew a long breath.
</p>

<p>
"It&mdash;it&mdash;looks like the sapphire chest," he
gasped.  "Oh, Nat!"
</p>

<p>
The others merely looked their astonishment.
In a few rapid words Nat supplied that part of
the narrative of their escape dealing with the
recovery of the chest, and which he had up to that
moment purposely omitted.
</p>

<p>
"And now, boys," he concluded, "let's get a line
over and hoist her on board.  I, for one, am dying
to feast my eyes on the sapphires once more
and gloat over the way we've fooled those
scoundrels of Morello's."
</p>

<p>
Sam Hinckley slipped over the side and soon
made fast a turn around the box.  How many
pairs of willing hands hauled that box on board
I leave you to imagine.
</p>

<p>
At last, dripping with water, there it stood on
the bridge.  They gathered about it half
awesomely.  There was something in its eventful
history that gave pause to their somewhat noisy
merriment.  Silently they stood about, gazing
with burning eyes while Nat fitted the key which
he still carried.  The lock was a simple one of
old-fashioned make, and opened easily.
</p>

<p>
The young Motor Ranger swung back the lid
with a gesture.
</p>

<p>
There, spread out over its precious contents
was the same bit of canvas that they had placed
there before the treasure chest had been filched.
Nat's pulses beat a bit faster as he raised one
corner of the canvas and prepared to disclose
once more to their view the wonderful contents
that lay beneath.
</p>

<p>
He raised it with a sweeping gesture and an
exclamation of triumph which changed midway
to a shout of dismay.
</p>

<p>
The box contained no precious sapphire hoard!
</p>

<p>
In place of the gem-bearing rocks, which they
had expected to meet their gaze, the group on
the bridge stared into a box filled with old bits
of iron ballast, ropes ends, damaged blocks, and
other bits of marine odds and ends.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Morello had tricked them.
</p>

<p>
In the place of the blazing sapphires, the box
held nothing but so much worthless old junk!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
A MENACE OF OLD OCEAN.
</h3>

<p>
"Gone!" exclaimed Joe Hartley, in a hollow
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Ker-ker-ker-clean ger-ger-gone!" stuttered
Ding-dong Bell.
</p>

<p>
"The scoundrels," ground out Captain Akers
through clinched teeth.
</p>

<p>
All had some exclamation of anger or dismay
to contribute.  Such a completely dumfounded
ship's company was never afloat on the Pacific,
surely.
</p>

<p>
"I see it all now," burst out Nat suddenly,
"Morello and Dayton could not trust even their
own men, so they removed the sapphires from the
chest and concealed them elsewhere, all the time
leaving the chest in plain view so as to create
the impression that all was open and above board.
Oh, the rascals!  They cannot even be fair and
square with their own associates."
</p>

<p>
The boy stopped short.  He was overcome with
chagrin at the thought that he had risked liberty
and life for the sake of an utterly worthless
chest.
</p>

<p>
For some time they could think or talk of
nothing else.  It was Captain Akers, who, with his
good, solid common sense as usual to the fore,
brought them up with a round turn.
</p>

<p>
"No use crying over what can't be helped,
boys," he said briskly.  "The question now
is&mdash;what are we to do?"
</p>

<p>
"What indeed," repeated Joe, in a sadly
puzzled tone.
</p>

<p>
Nat did not speak.  Half crazy with mortification
over the way in which he had been fooled he
stood gazing out over the trackless void of the
sunny Pacific.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my suggestion is this," said Captain
Akers: "Let's take after the rascals."
</p>

<p>
"Pursue them!"
</p>

<p>
The exclamation came from Nat, and, although
it chimed in well enough with his wishes just
then, somehow the blunt way in which the
daring proposal had been made had startled him.
</p>

<p>
"That's the idea," rejoined Captain Akers, "we
know where the beggars are bound for.  Captain
Nelsen and myself are both good navigators.  We
have plenty of gasolene on board, and, anyhow,
if the worst comes to the worst, the 'Nomad' can
proceed under sail.  Come, what do you say?"
</p>

<p>
A long discussion followed, for what they were
about to consider was not a project to be lightly
rushed into.  Perhaps if they had not been so
wrought up over the discovery that the chest was
empty, they would never have entertained the idea
for an instant.  But, in their then frame of mind,
to overtake the rascals of Morello's band and
deliver them over to justice was their chief and
burning desire.  It was Captain Nelsen then who
clinched the argument by saying:
</p>

<p>
"Dere iss a French court of law, undt an
American consul, in der Marquesas.  Vee needt nodt
take der madder into our own handts.  Ledt us
follow dose no-gooters oop undt ven vee logade
dem vee can communicade mit der authorisers.
Vee both have haf a lodt to gain.  I vant my
stolen schooner back.  In yust der same vay you
vant your sapphiras."
</p>

<p>
"Yy-y-you are n-n-n-no An-an-an-ananias
when you say that," struck in Ding-dong.  "We
certainly do want our sapphiras."
</p>

<p>
And so the matter was decided.  It was then
high noon and the two captains both "shot the
sun" with Captain Akers' instruments and then
the latter went to the cabin to work out their
observations on the chart and lay a course for
Odahmi.  In the meantime, Sam Hinckley was
ordered below to the engines and the "Nomad"
was sent ahead on a direct westerly course till a
proper one could be laid out.
</p>

<p>
Before starting, however, the boat, which had
played such a prominent part in the escape of
Nat and Captain Nelsen, was cut loose and
allowed to go adrift.  The "Nomad" carried a boat
of her own, on davits, besides two collapsible
ones, so that the little craft would have been of
no use to her company.
</p>

<p>
With Joe at the wheel, and Ding-dong in the
galley cooking up a hasty dinner, the start was
made.  But neither Nat nor Captain Nelsen heard
the "go-ahead" bell ring, for they both,
thoroughly exhausted by recent events, were sound
asleep on two of the Pullman berths.
</p>

<p>
Some half an hour later Captain Akers had
completed his final calculations and came on deck
with instructions for the man at the wheel.  As
it so turned out, the course on which they had
been sailing was not so very much out of the way
of the corrected one, so that, after all, they had
not lost much headway.
</p>

<p>
"At this rate, with decent luck, we ought to
overhaul that schooner of yours before many
days have passed," observed Captain Akers to
Captain Nelsen that evening when they were all
out on the deck after supper, enjoying the cool
breeze that swept toward them from the westward.
</p>

<p>
"In that case what will we do?" wondered
Nat; "board them and give them a fight?"
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to, just as well as you boys would,"
he said; "but I don't know whether it would be a
wise plan.  No, my idea, if you don't mind
hearing the suggestion of an old sailor, would be to
reach the islands first and head the schooner off.
In that case we can have a French gunboat&mdash;for
the islands belong to the French&mdash;or, at least,
some sort of a government craft on hand to give
the rascals the welcome they deserve when they
arrive."
</p>

<p>
"I ker-ker-can suggest a g-g-g-g-good&mdash;Phwit!&mdash;bit
of jewelry for Colonel Morello if
you wish to make him a gift when we meet
again."
</p>

<p>
The remark came from Ding-dong whose trick
it was at the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" asked Joe.
</p>

<p>
"A p-p-p-p-p-ppair of ster-ster-steel
bub-bub-bracelets," rejoined Ding-dong in such a droll
voice that they all had to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this has been a scorching day and no
mistake," observed Captain Akers, when the
laugh had subsided; "almost too sultry for these
latitudes at this time of year.  I hope we are not
in for a spell of more bad weather.  The last
time I looked at the barometer it puzzled me by
the way it was acting."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" inquired Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Why, from my experience at sea I should
say that it betokened the near presence of some
remarkable phenomenon, such as frequently
occur on the Pacific."
</p>

<p>
"There is a funny kind of feeling in the air for
a fact," said Nat.
</p>

<p>
It had suddenly fallen a dead flat calm, and
the "jiggle" of the "Nomad's" steadily working
propeller was the only bit of motion observable
on the unrippled ocean.
</p>

<p>
Captain Nelsen said nothing, but contented
himself with gazing over toward the western
horizon, where the sun was setting in a blaze of
purple and gold magnificence.
</p>

<p>
"I dond't like der look of dot sunset," he said
presently; "it looks to me like&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what's that thing away off there?" cried
Joe, suddenly pointing toward the sunset.
</p>

<p>
They all looked in the direction he indicated
and could make out plainly enough, against the
glowing panorama, a queer, waving pillar of
darkness.  It looked like a long, thin cloud set on
end.
</p>

<p>
As they gazed at it, it waved tremulously, and
beyond the shadow of a doubt it grew larger.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like one of those dust devils we see
at home, only a hundred times as large," said Joe.
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers, whose face had suddenly
grown very grave, spoke up.
</p>

<p>
"That's just what it is, Joe," he said; "a huge
dust devil.  That thing yonder is a waterspout.
It's coming this way.  I hope it does not strike
us or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused ominously.
</p>

<p>
"Or what?" asked Joe curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Or we may be in grave danger," concluded
Captain Akers.
</p>

<p>
They all looked somewhat alarmed.  Nat had
read about waterspouts in the geography books,
but he had never been at close quarters with the
strange columns of water stretching from sea to
sky, and engulfing all that they encounter.
</p>

<p>
"Look!  Look!" cried Joe suddenly.  "There
are more of them!"
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, so there are," exclaimed
Captain Akers, gazing anxiously to the westward.
</p>

<p>
Coming toward them, at a seemingly terrific
rate, and spinning and dancing in a sort of gigantic
witches' dance, were a dozen or more of the
writhing, twisting water pillars.
</p>

<p>
A moaning sound filled the air, and it began
to grow very dark suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Against the gathering curtain of blackness the
ghastly forms of the huge waterspouts stood
out menacingly.
</p>

<p>
If it had not been for their constant sinuous,
snaky, undulating movements they might have
been mistaken for the immense marble columns
upholding the roof of a huge cathedral.
</p>

<p>
But these columns upheld the canopy of the
sky, and found their nether resting place on the
Pacific Ocean.
</p>

<p>
The boys' faces gleamed whitely in the heavy
dusk that had fallen as the witches' dance of the
waterspouts grew closer.  They could now see
the waves boiling at their feet as the spouts
sucked the water up into the sky.  Would they
manage to escape the waterspouts, or would the
"Nomad" be trapped in their path?
</p>

<p>
Anxiously as they hung on the answer to the
question, it was impossible of solution just then.
But one thing was certain, not one of the party
on board the motor cruiser had ever been in a
situation of graver danger.

CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
ADRIFT.
</h3>

<p>
All at once Joe uttered a shrill cry:
</p>

<p>
"That big fellow yonder.  It's coming right
for us."
</p>

<p>
"By dunder, dot's right," shouted Captain Nelsen,
who, clutching the rail of the bridge, stood
by the lad's side.  "Hard over midt your helm
dere, boy."
</p>

<p>
Joe spun the wheel over, but as he did so it
suddenly turned loose in his hands.
</p>

<p>
A cry of consternation broke from his lips:
</p>

<p>
"The tiller ropes are broken!"
</p>

<p>
Nat echoed his comrade's alarmed shout.  As
for Ding-dong, he turned white under his tan.
</p>

<p>
The "Nomad" rolled helplessly in the trough
of the now aroused seas, while at a distance of
not more than a few hundred yards the nearest
of the immense waterspouts was roaring down
upon her.  For an instant they looked dismayed
into the grim face of danger.
</p>

<p>
It looked as if there was not a chance of their
escaping from being engulfed by the monster
spout.  In this emergency even Captain Akers
stood irresolute.  It was clear that he was
nonplussed by the nearness of the peril.
</p>

<p>
Nat was the first to regain his wits.
</p>

<p>
"The saluting cannon&mdash;quick!"
</p>

<p>
He had recalled in a flash of inspiration
having read in some book of voyages that a shot
will sometimes shatter a waterspout.
</p>

<p>
He was by no means certain that it would work
out in practice, but the plan in their present
desperate situation was well worth trying, at all
events.
</p>

<p>
The saluting cannon was bolted to the starboard
side of the bridge.  A full charge of powder,
placed there when she had arrived in Santa
Inez with the idea of firing a salute, was in place.
All that was needed was some missile to ram
home on top of it, for, of course, the charge was blank.
</p>

<p>
The chest with its collection of metal and wood
odds and ends still lay close at hand.  They had
been too disgusted to touch it that afternoon.
Right on top was a big slug of iron, which had
been used on the "Nettie Nelsen" as a weight for
the sounding line.  It was the work of an instant
with Nat to ram this home in the cannon and
place a wad of canvas in on top of it.
</p>

<p>
The others watched him in silence.  Only
Captain Akers and Captain Nelsen had any idea of
what he was after, and they deemed it more prudent
to say nothing that might interrupt the lad.
</p>

<p>
The waterspout was now terribly near.  Its
roar was deafening and its mighty crest was
hidden in an aurora of mist and spray.  Big, angry
waves rolled and tossed at its squirming base.
</p>

<p>
Swinging the cannon round on its pivot, Nat
aimed the weapon full at the advancing spout.
With a silent prayer he jerked the lanyard that
fired the charge.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-144"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-144.jpg" alt="Nat aimed the weapon full at the advancing spout.  Bang! A red flash of flame split the gloom." />
<br />
Nat aimed the weapon full at the advancing spout.  <br />
Bang! A red flash of flame split the gloom.
</p>

<p>
Bang!
</p>

<p>
A red flash of flame split the gloom as the
missile sped.
</p>

<p>
"Hang on for your lives!" came simultaneously
a shout from Captain Akers.
</p>

<p>
It was lucky for them that they took the advice.
Down on their faces, clinging to the lowermost
rail of the bridge, they all flung themselves, Joe
leaving his useless wheel.
</p>

<p>
As the weight with which Nat had loaded the
cannon struck the waterspout, shattering it as if
it had been made of glass, the mighty structure
broke in a gigantic cascade of water.  To the
boys, clinging with might and main to the rails, it
appeared as if the bottom had fallen out of the
heavens, letting down tons of green water.  The
force of the torrent drove the breath out of their
bodies and choked and stunned them with its
pressure.  Beneath them they could feel the
"Nomad" tremble from stem to stern at the shock.
Mingling with the roar of the descending mass of
fluid came a shout of dismay from Sam Hinckley
at his engines.
</p>

<p>
In the emergency there had been no time to
warn him.  The firing of the gun had been the
first intimation he had received that anything
unusual was going on forward.
</p>

<p>
He had started up the stairway from his engine
room as he heard the sharp report, only to
be met by an inundation of water that swept
him backward among his engines, gasping, half
drowned and with the clothes ripped almost off
his back.
</p>

<p>
But despite all this, the "Nomad" had been
saved by Nat's quick wit.  The other waterspouts
waltzed past her, roaring furiously, but not one
of them touched her, and when, after they had
passed, the semi-suffocated crew struggled to
their feet and surveyed the havoc about them,
the waterspouts were already some distance off,
whirling eastward on their destructive course,
surrounded by their gloomy pall of dusky cloud.
</p>

<p>
The sea behind them was white and angry, and
upon it the "Nomad," crippled by her useless
steering gear, bobbed about like an empty bottle.
It was some time before her company recovered
their wits sufficiently to take stock of what
had happened.  When they did, they could not
refrain from laughing at the ridiculous appearance
they all presented, Sam Hinckley most of
all.
</p>

<p>
The only garment left him was half a pair of
trousers.  The force of the wave had torn off the
rest.  Moreover, in the tumblefication in the
engine room, a big can of black grease had torn
loose and Sam, in his struggles, had come in
contact with it, plentifully bedaubing himself with
the inky stuff.
</p>

<p>
"We look like a lot of drowned rats," laughed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"And I f-f-f-f-f-f-feel like one," sputtered out
Ding-dong ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"Well, get below and into dry clothes," ordered
Captain Akers, "and then brew some good
hot coffee.  In the meantime we'll see what
damage has been done and then get into dry togs,
too."
</p>

<p>
The damage, on examination, proved to be
serious enough.  The "Nomad's" boat had been
torn off her davits and only a few splinters
suspended by the "falls" remained to show that she
had once hung there.  A ventilator had also been
smashed and a port light stove in.
</p>

<p>
"Thank goodness we've still got the portable
boats," breathed Nat, "or we would be in a fix,
indeed."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," agreed Captain Akers, "but as
things are we must be thankful it isn't any worse.
Any one of us might just as easily have had a
limb broken as not."
</p>

<p>
"I guess the first thing to be done is to reeve
a new tiller line," said Joe.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," agreed the captain.  "We must
be off our course now.  Suppose you boys get to
work at once at that, while Sam and I take stock
of the engine room and get the pumps going.
Sam says there is a foot of water in his domain."
</p>

<p>
The boys knew where the supplies were kept in
a locker in the afterpart of the cockpit, and they
soon had a new tiller rope adjusted.  By this
time Sam and Captain Akers had ascertained
that the engines had sustained no damage but a
short circuit of the ignition apparatus.  It would
take some time to fix this, however, so it was
decided to lay to for the night.
</p>

<p>
But on the anchor being lowered it was found
that even by joining the longest cables on board
together no bottom could be reached.  They were
in the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean.  Miles
of blue water lay under their keel.  Infinite
vastnesses of depth, almost unthinkable in their
profundity.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge gave the boys a little shudder,
but soon more practical thoughts ousted their
mysterious feelings.
</p>

<p>
"What are we to do?" asked Joe.  "If we don't
anchor, we shall drift miles off our course."
</p>

<p>
"Why, let's up sail and take a spin under canvas
for a while," said Captain Akers.  "It will
give us a chance to see how the 'Nomad' behaves
under her auxiliary power."
</p>

<p>
This was voted an excellent plan, and accordingly,
the masts were soon gotten out of their
receptacles and the sections of which they were
composed fitted together.  Of itself this gave the
"sticks" a rigid construction, but they were also
provided with steel wire stays, which, by means
of turnbuckles, could be tautened like piano wires
after they had been hooked into their places.
</p>

<p>
This done, all that remained was to hoist the
canvas and get under way once more.  The sails
were two leg-of-mutton shaped canvases, with
a small jib in the bow to balance the large after-sail.
</p>

<p>
"Donnervetter," exclaimed Captain Nelsen,
when the sails were in place and began to "draw,"
"dis iss vere I am righdt at my home, by Yupiter.
Idt feels a whole lot more natural to be
under canvas dan sailing aroundt on a marine
gasolene stove."
</p>

<p>
"In that case you can take the wheel," laughed
Nat, "for I don't know a whole lot about steering
a sailing vessel."
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, the captain assumed the helm,
while the rest went below to give what help they
could in overhauling the engines.
</p>

<p>
The captain hummed a merry old sea tune to
himself as the sails filled and the "Nomad"
began to forge ahead.  By his side stood Cal
Gifford, whom we have rather lost sight of recently.
The fact is, that Cal at sea was by no means so
self-assertive a person as Cal ashore.  The
former stage driver had been suddenly plunged into,
what was to him, an entirely novel and somewhat
harrying existence.
</p>

<p>
The "Nomad," answering her helm like a race
horse, made good headway, and in the meantime
the party in the engine room labored unceasingly.
At last all was declared in readiness to test the
engine.  But when Sam operated the mechanism
that should have resulted in starting the motor
they did no more than turn over lazily, with a
sort of hoarse cough, and then stop dead.
</p>

<p>
Again and again he tried to start them, but
they stubbornly resisted.
</p>

<p>
"Take a look at the carburetors," suggested Nat.
</p>

<p>
Sam bent over one of the brass mixing chambers
and then looked up with an odd expression.
</p>

<p>
"Queer," he said; "no wonder the engines
wouldn't start.  No gasolene."
</p>

<p>
"No gasolene!" echoed Captain Akers.  "We
must examine the tanks at once.  There should
be a supply enough to last for several weeks
more."
</p>

<p>
"It can't have leaked out, or we'd have smelled
it," said Joe.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Captain Akers, who looked rather
worried, "the tanks are provided with out-board
drains, so that in case of a leak no gasolene can
get into the boat and cause an explosion."
</p>

<p>
A brief examination of the main tank served
to confirm the fear which had already formed
itself in Captain Akers' heart.
</p>

<p>
Through a big leak, caused where a seam had
ripped open under the strain of the exploded
waterspout, the precious driving fluid of the
"Nomad" had nearly all escaped.
</p>

<p>
Worse still, the auxiliary tanks were also found
to be almost emptied, their supply being fed by
pressure into the main one.  So large was the
leak that scores of gallons had escaped into the
sea by the time it was discovered.
</p>

<p>
"Then we are stuck without power to go ahead
or turn back!" exclaimed Nat, voicing the
general dismay.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't count the sails, which are only
good when the wind blows, I guess you have hit
it right, lad," said Captain Akers, very soberly.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
A MYSTERIOUS CRAFT.
</h3>

<p>
A more careful examination showed that they
had not underestimated the seriousness of the loss
of the motive fluid.  Moreover, in reviewing the
situation, it became apparent that unless they
made for Honolulu, which port was still a great
distance off, they would not be able to renew their
supply.
</p>

<p>
Still more alarming was the prospect involving
the food supply.  Under power, as the "Nomad"
had been provisioned for the voyage down
the coast, they would have had enough and to
spare.  But depending on sail for driving them
along it was doubtful if the provisions would
last nearly all the distance.
</p>

<p>
In fact, after a consultation had been held in
the cabin, they had to own, with what bitterness
you may suppose, that the expedition must be
abandoned and a return for the California coast
begun.  Even at that, if they met contrary winds
it might be days before they reached it.
</p>

<p>
The sleep of those on board the "Nomad" that
night was broken and disturbed.  Little was said
after the decision to abandon the chase of the
schooner had been reached.  But how all felt
about it could have been seen before they retired,
by their gloomy countenances and voices.  It was
in truth a sad blow to them all.  Even Cal, who,
as has been said, had no great love for the water,
took a keen interest in the object of the voyage,
namely to bring the wrongdoers to book.  He was
heartily disgusted at this termination to all their
plans.  As for Sam Hinckley, the engineer, he
sat in silence in his motionless, silent engine room,
gloomily staring at his unmoving engines.
</p>

<p>
Such was the state of mind of all on board
when, at dawn the next day, Joe Hartley, who
was at the wheel, brought all hands up out of
the cabin in all stages of dress and undress by
a cry of:
</p>

<p>
"Sail ho!"
</p>

<p>
The "Nomad" was staggering along under her
canvas, making a pretty picture, but gaining
woefully few miles.  Her build was not adapted for
sailing and her progress was snail-like.  At the
rate she was going it might be weeks even before
the coast was sighted.
</p>

<p>
The sail that Joe had seen was as yet some distance
off, and, as well as could be made out, it
was a schooner.
</p>

<p>
"What if she should be the 'Nettie Nelsen'?"
wondered Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Well," rejoined Cal grimly, "I reckon we'd
have nothing much to fear from those chaps in
a fair fight.  They're all right when they kin
make use of treachery and deceit, but in a square
scrap they are no account.  I reckon we proved
that when the posse rounded 'em up in the canyon."
</p>

<p>
"That is so," agreed Nat, and in this opinion
the others concurred.  Just the same, it gave
them queer little thrills to think that by a strange
chance they might be coming to close quarters
with the men who had done them so many
wrongs.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast was prepared by Ding-dong and
despatched without their being any appreciable
distance nearer to the strange schooner.  But a
short time after the meal a brisk breeze sprang
up and the "Nomad" went staggering right
gallantly along before it.
</p>

<p>
The schooner at the same time drew closer to
her, both vessels sailing with the wind on what
sailors call "the beam."
</p>

<p>
"She's nodt mein schooner, dot is a sure for
certain fact," pronounced Captain Nelsen, after
a prolonged scrutiny of the distant craft through
his marine glasses.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" inquired Joe.  "She looks
almost exactly like her."
</p>

<p>
"Yah, but der 'Neddie Nelsen' had a green
stripe round her bulvurks.  Dis schooner has a
vite line."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe they've changed the color.  I've heard
of such things being done."
</p>

<p>
The remark came from Captain Akers.  Presently
he took the glasses from Captain Nelsen
and in his turn focused them on the oncoming
schooner which seemed to be plunging along at a
great rate.
</p>

<p>
"Well, dash my buttons, that's queer!" he exclaimed,
after a minute or two of close observation.
A puzzled look crept over his face as he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"What's queer?" inquired Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I can't seem to see any one on her decks."
</p>

<p>
"Not even a man at the wheel?" asked Nat,
in an astonished tone.
</p>

<p>
"No; not a soul.  Here, you take the glasses
and observe her.  Your eyes are younger than
mine."
</p>

<p>
With this he handed the binoculars to the boy.
But Nat, and the others in their turn, were unable
to spy any living being on the schooner's
decks.
</p>

<p>
"There is some mystery of the sea there,"
decided Captain Akers.  "In my opinion that ship
has been abandoned for some good reason."
</p>

<p>
"But she is sailing along as if some hand were
guiding her course," said Nat.
</p>

<p>
"That is true; but the helm may have been
lashed before her crew skipped out.  If that is
the case with this slant of wind, she would
naturally be sailing along as if all was well."
</p>

<p>
"Shall we board her and see what is the
matter?" asked Nat eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"That will be a difficult and perhaps a dangerous
task," was the response.  "That schooner
is going at quite a speed and if we ran alongside
with the 'Nomad' she might run us down."
</p>

<p>
"Phew!  Then we would be in a fix," exclaimed
Joe.  "I guess we'd better give her a wide
berth."
</p>

<p>
"Look!" cried Cal suddenly, as the schooner,
without diminishing her speed in the least, drew
closer.  "Look, what's the matter with her flag?
It don't look natural, somehow."
</p>

<p>
The attention of all thus directed to the ensign,
which hung at the vessel's peak, they could now
see that it was upside down&mdash;a signal of distress
the wide seas over.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!" exclaimed Captain Akers.
"That puts a different complexion on the matter
altogether.  I begin to think that it may be our
duty as Christian beings to board that craft.
Perhaps her crew are suffering from some malady
or affliction that has crippled them and they may
be lying helpless below at this very moment."
</p>

<p>
This was not an attractive picture, and Nat
could not repress a feeling of depression as the
schooner drew closer and they could take in her
details.  She was a black vessel of some hundred
feet or more in length, with tapering spars and
well-cut sails, and evidently possessed plenty of
speed.  Under her bowsprit they could now make
out a gilded figure-head&mdash;the image of a woman
apparently holding a trident aloft.
</p>

<p>
"The Island Queen!" read off Captain Akers,
focusing his glasses on the vessel's bow name
board as she drew closer.
</p>

<p>
"She's as preddy a liddle ship as der 'Nettie
Nelsen,' almost," pronounced Captain Nelsen.
</p>

<p>
"She is a fine schooner for a fact," agreed Nat.
"I'd like to get on board her and penetrate the
mystery of her desertion or disaster."
</p>

<p>
"M-m-m-m-m-maybe she's lul-lul-lul-leaking!"
</p>

<p>
The suggestion came, of course, from Ding-dong.
</p>

<p>
"If she is, it's not as much as your parts of
speech are," laughed Joe.  "She's quite high out
of the water."
</p>

<p>
Much more speculation of this sort was indulged
in as the two vessels drew closer together.
</p>

<p>
They met and passed before Captain Akers
had made up his mind whether or not to risk
boarding her.  But as they drew close, and the
squeaking and straining of the schooner's blocks
and rigging could be distinctly heard, there came
a sudden sound from the mysterious vessel that
struck a chill to all their hearts.
</p>

<p>
It was a long-drawn-out scream, uttered in
what seemed to be a human voice, and yet was
unlike any they had ever heard.
</p>

<p>
Again and again the terrible cry rang out,
while they regarded each other with blanched faces.
</p>

<p>
What could it mean?
</p>

<p>
There was not a soul to be seen on her decks
as the schooner swayed by, but the scream was
terribly real and appealing.
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers was the first to recover his wits
in the presence of this startling mystery.
</p>

<p>
"Boys," he exclaimed, looking round at them
all with a determined air, "there's some terrible
secret aboard that schooner, and I'm going to find
out what it is if the Lord will let me.  The wind's
dropping now.  In a short time I shouldn't wonder
if it fell a dead calm.  If it does, we can get
out the collapsible boat and row over to her.
Do you agree with me?"
</p>

<p>
"We certainly do," Nat answered for the rest
in an agitated voice.  "If there are some human
beings in trouble on board that schooner, we'll
do our best to help them, as Americans should do."
</p>

<p>
"That's the talk, boy.  Now, Joe, put about
and take after the schooner.  I'm going below to
overhaul my shooting-irons, for if we shan't have
occasion to use them before long, my name isn't
Tom Akers."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
A FACE THAT TERRIFIED.
</h3>

<p>
Before long, as the captain had foreseen, the
wind decreased from the fresh breeze that had
been blowing to a dead, glassy calm.  The sea
grew smooth and rippleless, while the sun shone
down blistering on two becalmed vessels&mdash;the
"Nomad" and the "Island Queen."
</p>

<p>
The latter lay rolling in the swell at about
half-a-mile's distance when the wind finally gave out
altogether.  Her sails flapped idly against her
masts, and, neglected as they were, she looked
the very picture of desolation.
</p>

<p>
The "Nomad" was run as close as possible to
the becalmed vessel, but lack of wind compelled
her, too, to come to a standstill at the distance
mentioned.  One of the collapsible boats was at
once gotten out from under the cockpit floor and
the sections, of which it was composed, clamped
together.  Then it was hoisted on the davits upon
which the boat, which had been swept away had
hung, and dropped overboard.
</p>

<p>
An instant later Captain Akers, Nat, Joe, and
Ding-dong Bell piled into it, leaving the rest on
board the "Nomad."  The three lads had been
selected by the captain to accompany him, for,
owing to the small size of the boat, it would have
been impossible to accommodate more within her
limited dimensions.  Some disappointment was
felt by the "stay-at-homes," but their work was
cut out for them, too, as Captain Akers, before
he left the ship, told them to be on the lookout
with rifles, and in case any unforeseen things
happened on the mysterious schooner to open fire
on the attackers of the "Nomad" party.
</p>

<p>
For Captain Akers, for some reason or other,
had quite made up his mind privately that they
were going to meet with opposition in attempting
to board the schooner.  It was, therefore,
somewhat of a shock to him when, after a long,
hot pull, they reached the schooner's side to find
that no human voice or presence opposed them.
</p>

<p>
The vessel rolled idly on the calm swells, without
a sound to break the stillness all about her
but the complaining of her sails and rigging.
Nor after they had made fast the boat and boarded
the vessel by the forechains did they encounter
anything to give them pause.
</p>

<p>
The "Island Queen" seemed to be a typical
craft of her kind.  Flush decked with a
white-painted galley forward right aft of the foremast
and a commodious deck-house aft.  Her decks
were clean swept and showed no trace of disorder.
Ropes were neatly coiled and everything
seemed to be in apple-pie order.
</p>

<p>
"What can be the secret of this old derelict?"
wondered Nat, in a subdued voice.
</p>

<p>
Somehow, since setting foot on the abandoned
craft's decks, they had all felt constrained to
speak in whispers.  Even bluff Captain Akers
was no exception to the general rule.  There is
something peculiarly impressive about treading
the deck of an abandoned ship&mdash;a feeling both
sinister and melancholy.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Captain Akers, after he had
glanced rapidly but comprehensively about him,
"the state of her decks proves conclusively that
there was no bloody mutiny on board, as I had
begun to think."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe we can find out something by entering
the cabin," suggested Joe Hartley.
</p>

<p>
"An excellent idea, Joe," approved the captain.
"Forward then and, boys, have your pistols ready
for instant use.  We may encounter nothing and
we may run across something that will put us on
our mettle."
</p>

<p>
With rather disturbed nerves, and pulses that
beat faster than usual, the boys followed Captain
Akers aft.  The door of the deck-house was
unlocked and swung on its hinges rhythmically as
the ship swayed on the rise and fall of the bosom
of the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
"You go first," whispered Joe, shoving Nat
forward.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I like that&mdash;&mdash;" began Nat indignantly,
but neither of the boys was required to test his
nerve by being the first to enter the place.
Captain Akers spared them that.
</p>

<p>
With a quick, light step, the old seaman made
his way within, followed by the awe-struck boys.
</p>

<p>
But if they had expected to see anything
remarkable in the cabin, they were disappointed.
It was an entirely ordinary place.  In the center,
a swinging table covered with a red cloth.  A
few books on navigation of the Pacific were stuck
on a shelf in one corner.  Two staterooms opened
off it astern, evidently for the occupancy of the
captain and mate.  But an investigation of these
yielded no more results than had their scrutiny of
the outer cabin.
</p>

<p>
The bed clothes in the bunks were tumbled
about as if the occupants had left hastily and
several articles of clothing lay scattered about in
the same helter-skelter fashion.  But that was
all.
</p>

<p>
"No use looking any further here," announced
Captain Akers, after a thorough examination of
the place had been made.  "This cabin is just such
a one as you might find on board any schooner
plying this ocean.  I guess we were fooling
ourselves on the mystery part of this."
</p>

<p>
"How about those screams?" asked Nat quickly.
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers looked rather foolish.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, I forgot those!" he exclaimed.
"That's so, they were terrible cries, but for all
that this schooner shows to the contrary; we
must have dreamed we heard them.  I think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look there!" cried Nat suddenly, seizing the
captain's sleeve and pointing through a porthole,
which looked out on the deck.
</p>

<p>
The captain looked, but could see nothing.  He
turned to the boy who seemed strangely excited
and was pale and trembling.
</p>

<p>
"What was it?" he asked.  "What did you see, Nat?"
</p>

<p>
"A face!" was the startling reply.  "It was
peering in through that porthole at us, but the
instant I looked up it vanished."
</p>

<p>
"Was it a man's face?" asked Captain Akers,
deeply interested.  The others were off at
another part of the cabin and Nat was glad, for
he did not wish them to hear the alarming
intelligence.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was a man's face, as well as I can
describe it.  But it was a terrible one.  It was hairy
and had two little beady eyes set deep in it that
glinted with hate as they looked at us.  Who
could it have been?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, my hearty, we'll soon find out.  I'm a
plain sailor and don't like mystery.  I'm going to
get to the bottom of this.  Where did you say
the skulker was&mdash;outside that port?  Then it
ought to be easy to find him."
</p>

<p>
With this, and with Nat close at his heels, he
dashed out of the cabin on to the deck.
</p>

<p>
But to their utter astonishment the schooner
looked just as before.  No human figure could
be seen crouching behind some obstruction and
peering at the intruders.
</p>

<p>
Nor could they find any tracks under the port
through which Nat was positive he had seen the
formidable face peering.
</p>

<p>
Who, then, could it have been?  And where
had he concealed himself?
</p>

<p>
The forward deck-house was the place that naturally
suggested itself to them.  Led by the captain,
the two young adventurers started for the
small white structure.
</p>

<p>
"Whoever you are, my man," exclaimed the
captain, as he laid hand on the door and thrust
it open, "don't dare to try any monkey tricks
with us.  We'll stand for no nonsense and are
armed."
</p>

<p>
With these words he pushed open the door.
But the place, which was evidently a kind of
galley&mdash;or cook house&mdash;combined with sleeping
accommodations of a rough character, was empty.
A rusty sea-range with pots and pans still on it
stretched along the forward end, and cooking
materials stood all about.  A big barrel of rolled
oats, with the top off, stood half open.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" exclaimed the captain, as he gazed
into it, "some one's dipped into this lately."
</p>

<p>
So much was clear.  The contents of the barrel
had evidently been disturbed by somebody helping
himself; but who?
</p>

<p>
As he propounded the question to himself, Nat
looked up, and almost gave way to a shrill cry of
alarm as he did so.
</p>

<p>
There was a small, square, unglazed window
above the stove&mdash;apparently put there for ventilation.
</p>

<p>
In this aperture as he glanced up he had, for
the second time, encountered the terrible hairy
face gazing in at them.  But as his eyes met the
bright, shifty orbs the visage vanished, and when
the others looked up the window was empty.
</p>

<p>
It was the work of but one second for Nat to
dash out of the cook house.  But swift as he was
the mysterious eavesdropper was quicker.  He
must have vanished with the celerity of a
Jack-in-the-box, for when Nat gained the deck not a
trace of anything unusual was to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"Say, this thing is getting on my nerves," the
lad exclaimed, as the others joined him and he
concluded his description of the second
appearance of the grim face.
</p>

<p>
"I don't blame you, my boy," rejoined Captain
Akers.  "Seriously, if I was as superstitious as
some seamen, I'd say that this craft was haunted.
There hardly seems to be any other explanation
for it."
</p>

<p>
"Except that disturbed oat barrel," put in Joe
uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"That's just it," responded the captain; "that
makes it look as if something human was on
board.  But in that case why should they avoid us
and play such pranks as have just occurred.  I
don't understand it and I don't half like it.  Let's
have a look at the cargo&mdash;there may be something
we require in it&mdash;and then I suggest that we make
the best of our way back to the 'Nomad.'"
</p>

<p>
The boys agreed heartily and watched with
some interest while Captain Akers removed the
cover of the forward hatch.  As the battens were
lifted off a strange, familiar smell assailed their
nostrils, but before either of the boys could speak
Captain Akers gave a cry of astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Case oil!  Kerosene!" he cried.  "Hoor-ay,
boys!  This is the greatest discovery of the age.
We can run the engine of the 'Nomad' now till
further orders."
</p>

<p>
"Three cheers!" shouted Nat, fairly forgetting
in the joy of this great discovery the gloom which
the mystery of the schooner "Island Queen" had
cast over him.
</p>

<p>
Joe Hartley joined with a will in the jubilation.
It would have been a queer sight if any one could
have been looking on to see those three&mdash;the
grizzled seaman and the bright-faced boys&mdash;capering
about like lunatics in their joy at the discovery.
</p>

<p>
But in the midst of their jubilation they
received a sudden check.  Captain Akers had
bethought himself to look for the "Nomad."
</p>

<p>
A cry of consternation now rose to his lips and
was echoed by the boys as they ascertained its
cause.
</p>

<p>
The "Nomad" had vanished.
</p>

<p>
They were alone in mid-Pacific on the mysterious
schooner!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
WHAT BEFELL IN THE FOG.
</h3>

<p>
Captain Akers was the first to find a solution
of the mystery.
</p>

<p>
"Fog!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Sure enough they now perceived, as they would
have before had they not been too engrossed with
their investigations, that a white smother was
creeping up, enveloping sea and sky in its
all-embracing obscurity.  The mist had already blotted
out the "Nomad" from view and was now rolling
down like clouds of white steam upon the
schooner.  In a few moments they would be
enveloped in it.
</p>

<p>
"This is the worst predicament yet!" cried Nat,
as it dawned upon him that to think of returning
to the "Nomad" in such a smother would be
impossible.
</p>

<p>
As for Joe, he stood silent.  More alarmed,
though, than he cared to admit, Captain Akers
fingered his beard thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing's so bad but it might be worse," he
said soberly, "and if this fog will only lift within
a reasonable time we may yet be all right."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if the 'Nomad' will only stay in her present
position," said Nat, "but the great Pacific
Drift sets in hereabouts and there is a strong
chance that if we are caught in it the two
vessels may be drifted far asunder by the time the
mists lift."
</p>

<p>
"That is so," admitted Captain Akers, "and it
is too deep to anchor, confound it!  Suppose we
try shouting to them.  Maybe they can catch our
hail, although with the atmosphere so dense, I
doubt it."
</p>

<p>
"It's worth trying," opined Nat, and then they
all three placed their hands funnelwise to their
mouths and set up a loud cry.
</p>

<p>
"No-o-o-om-a-a-a-a-a-a-d a-hoy!"
</p>

<p>
But, although they shouted till their voices
were cracked, they could catch no response.
</p>

<p>
The fog had shut down so thickly now that it
was impossible to see the forward part of the
deck from amidships where they stood.  It was
truly, as Nat had said, "the worst yet!" but they
pluckily set to work to make the best of it.
</p>

<p>
"After all," said Nat, "it might be far worse.
We've got a good ship under our feet and a
comfortable cabin to retire to.  There are provisions
in plenty, and if the worst comes to the worst
we can live for quite a time."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and there's water, too," put in Captain
Akers, more hopefully.  "I squinted into the
scuttle butt when we went by it and saw that it was
full of water.  I tasted it and it seemed quite
sweet and palatable."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," said Joe philosophically, "the only
thing to do is to make the best of it."
</p>

<p>
"That's the talk, Joe," came approvingly from Nat.
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Captain Akers, "suppose Joe
that you cook us a meal.  I guess we can all stand
some food, and it will enable us to face whatever
is to come with better courage, if we have plenty
of nourishment."
</p>

<p>
"A good idea, captain," said Nat, "and if you
don't mind I've got a suggestion to make."
</p>

<p>
"Make it, my lad."
</p>

<p>
"Why not put some provisions and water in
the small boat?  We never know what might
happen, and it would be a good thing in case we had
to abandon the 'Island Queen' to have the boat
stocked with food and water."
</p>

<p>
"You're a good, foresighted lad," approved
the captain.  "It might not be a bad idea to do
that first.  I noticed a small water keg on the
cabin house aft.  We'll fill that and lower it and
then follow it up with some canned stuff."
</p>

<p>
"I'll move the boat from the side to the stern,"
volunteered Nat, "while you and Joe select some
suitable stuff to provision her with."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, my boy."
</p>

<p>
And so it came about that, thanks to Nat's
foresight, the boat was stocked with food and
water, a fact which was to be of signal benefit to
at least one of the party later on, although, of
course, as they could not look into the future, not
one of them guessed this.
</p>

<p>
This work done, Joe bore an armful of canned
goods, potatoes and onions to the cook house.
Wood and coal were handy in a bin and he soon
had a roaring fire going in the stove.  While he
was at this work Nat and Captain Akers investigated
the cabin once more, but without lighting
on any solution of the mystery of the "Island
Queen's" abandonment.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon it will prove one of those mysteries
of the Pacific," said the captain.  "There are lots
of them every year, and few of them get into the
papers.  For instance, there was that Chinese
junk that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Help!  Help!"
</p>

<p>
The cry came from forward.
</p>

<p>
"It's Joe's voice!" shouted Nat.  "He's in trouble."
</p>

<p>
Seizing up his pistol which he had laid down,
Captain Akers was after the boy, who had
hastened forward in two bounds.
</p>

<p>
Joe met them, bouncing out of the fog, with a
white face.
</p>

<p>
"Nat!  Nat!" he cried in a scared voice.  "He's
at it again!"
</p>

<p>
"Who?" exclaimed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"What?" demanded the captain, his whiskers
bristling angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Why, that sailor, or ghost, or whatever it is,
that Nat saw.  I had just peeled my potatoes and
set them in a pan near the window and turned
my back for an instant when he, or it, or that,
showed up.  I had hardly turned before I heard
a slight noise behind me.  I switched round and
saw a big arm reaching through that window.
</p>

<p>
"Evidently its object was to steal some potatoes.
I shouted, but, instead of running away,
the fellow grabbed up the whole pan and threw
it at me.  I was too mad to be scared and ran
outside to grab him and ask him what he meant
by such conduct.  But when I got there the rascal
had gone."
</p>

<p>
"Just the same trick he played every time <i>I</i>
saw him," cried Nat.  "What on earth can it all
mean?  Do you think that there is a lunatic on
board this craft, captain?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what to think, my boy," rejoined
the captain seriously.  "Some things are beyond
human comprehension, and this is one of them.
If we have to spend the night on the craft, I'm
thinking we had better keep a strict watch, however."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," agreed Nat.  "This has gone past
any joking stage.  It's up to us to find out who
this rascal is, and what he means by playing such
pranks."
</p>

<p>
"And what those screams meant, too," said the
captain.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," chimed in Joe quaveringly.  "The
recollection of them makes me feel bad.  They were
the most blood-curdling cries I ever heard."
</p>

<p>
"They were that, my boy," agreed the captain,
"but I am now convinced that they did not
come from anybody else's throat but the ill-favored
wind-pipe of this fellow who is putting
up all these pranks."
</p>

<p>
"But we've looked all over the ship, in every
place in which he could hide," protested Nat, "and
not found a trace of him.  How do you account
for that?"
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" groaned the captain.  "I don't
pretend to account for it or anything else on this
extraordinary ship&mdash;I just give it up."
</p>

<p>
With this, Joe, with Nat for company, went
back to his cooking.  Dinner was prepared and
eaten without any recurrence of the events that
had so puzzled and mystified them.  Darkness
fell with the fog still hanging thick and dank; but
they made it all snug in the cabin by lighting the
hanging lamp, which cast a cheerful glow.
</p>

<p>
They wondered what was transpiring on board
the "Nomad" at that hour and many guesses were
made as to whether or no they had been caught
in the Pacific Drift.  From this the talk shifted
to tales of the South Pacific Islands, amid which
the captain had cruised when young.  He had
many interesting tales to tell of them and of the
manners and customs of their natives.
</p>

<p>
It was in the midst of one of his most exciting
narrations that something happened that brought
them all to their feet with bounding pulses and
thickly beating hearts.
</p>

<p>
From without had come distinctly the deep-toned
notes of a bell!
</p>

<p>
As they stood listening, the dismal tolling
recommenced.  There was something uncanny and
ghastly about it, coming, as it did, on board that
mysterious craft.
</p>

<p>
The chime was rung out in slow, funeral style.
</p>

<p>
Boom-boom!  Boom-boom!
</p>

<p>
Nat shuddered as he listened.  What could it
mean?  He determined to find out.
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers already had the door open and
stood peering forth.  The fog hung, dark and
dripping, all about them.  One could hardly see
ten paces away.  But, as well as they could judge,
the tolling came from the decks of the "Island
Queen" herself.
</p>

<p>
"It's that ship's bell!" cried Nat.  "I noticed
one forward this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the character of the ringing
changed.
</p>

<p>
The bell began to peal fast and furiously.  Its
clangor deafened and terrified.  It sounded as if
a madman had hold of the clapper string and was
trying to deafen any one within hearing.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!" shouted the captain; "that's another
of the rascal's tricks to scare us.  We'll
catch him at it this time, though, and when we
do&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He left the grim threat unfinished, as, pistol
in hand, he started forward through the fog.
Close on his heels came the boys, their hearts
beating entirely too fast for comfort.
</p>

<p>
As they started forward the ringing ceased
as abruptly as it had begun.
</p>

<p>
"That won't save you, you coward!" roared the
captain into the fog.  "Come on out, like a man,
and face the music.  Come on, you hound, and
take your lesson."
</p>

<p>
But, when, within one second's time, they
reached the bell which was hung just forward of
the foremast, there was nobody to be seen!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE "ISLAND QUEEN'S" SECRET.
</h3>

<p>
Well, I will leave you to imagine for yourselves
just how the boys looked and felt and acted
at this amazing discovery.
</p>

<p>
They were baffled, mystified, and, to tell the
truth, not a little alarmed.
</p>

<p>
A human enemy they would not have feared.
But in the darkness, with the moisture from the
fog dripping in a melancholy fashion on the deck,
the near presence of the supernatural&mdash;for such
was the only conclusion left&mdash;was, to say the
least, disquieting.
</p>

<p>
While they still stood there, gazing at each
other through the fog, with blank astonishment
depicted on their faces, their nerves were put to
a still further test.
</p>

<p>
The same sharp scream which had echoed from
the uncanny vessel as she drifted by the
"Nomad," of which they had since spoken with what
effect we know, sounded once more.
</p>

<p>
This time it seemed to proceed from above them.
</p>

<p>
From some point high up in the mist-laden air.
</p>

<p>
Shrill and terrible it rang out.  Their blood
was fairly chilled with horror.
</p>

<p>
What could it mean?
</p>

<p>
Nat was far too sensible a lad to believe in
ghosts.  So, too, was Joe.  As for Captain Akers,
he was superior to most seamen in the matter
of superstition, but he gave it now as his
unalterable conviction that the "Island Queen" was
haunted.
</p>

<p>
This was by no means a comfortable idea.
After some further search&mdash;although they
surmised beforehand it would be fruitless&mdash;the
adventurers made their way back to the cabin, sadly
puzzled and not a little confused.
</p>

<p>
After that one long scream from the upper
regions dead silence had fallen.  It was disturbed
only by the doleful drip-drip of the fog moisture
from the rigging.
</p>

<p>
"Well, boys," said the captain, as they reentered
the cabin, "I, for one, ain't sorry to be back
where there's light and comfort.  This thing is
becoming too much for me and I'm willing to own
that I'm beat by it.  Any one got any suggestions?"
</p>

<p>
Nobody had.  Soon after they turned in, as,
despite their uneasiness, all were tired out by the
exciting events of the day.  Nat volunteered to
take the first watch, it being arranged that at
midnight he was to awaken Captain Akers, who
would relieve him.
</p>

<p>
The lad took up his station by the door where
the steady breathing of the others soon apprised
him that they had passed into slumberland.  It
was an eerie sensation sitting there, looking out
on the fog-laden night and speculating&mdash;for, try
as he would, Nat could not help doing so&mdash;on the
nature of the invader who had so sadly disturbed
them.
</p>

<p>
He had his rifle in his hands and determined to
keep bright and wide awake, so that if anything
occurred which might have a bearing on the
mystery he would be able to solve it.  Just how
long he had sat there before something happened
to break the monotony Nat did not know.  It
might have been an hour or it might have been
two.  But he had noticed that the fog was
beginning to lift when at the same instant he
perceived a shadowy form come creeping along the
decks, making toward the stern.
</p>

<p>
The figure was bent almost double and swung
two long arms as it advanced.  After his first
gasp of surprise, Nat noted that the newcomer
was unarmed.  This thought gave him new courage
and, slipping within the shadow of the door,
he watched the figure's advance.
</p>

<p>
But, whatever its mission, it did not apparently
mean harm to the occupants of the cabin, for,
after a brief pause near there, it kept right on
to the stern.
</p>

<p>
As it passed Nat slipped out of his place of
concealment and took after it, treading softly
the while, so as not to alarm the marauder.  He
was curious to see what the fellow was up to.
When he did make out Nat was seized with a
sudden fury and sprang forward.
</p>

<p>
The figure, after advancing right up to the
stern-rail, could be seen, in the now clearing
atmosphere, to be fumbling with something.
</p>

<p>
"Great Ginger!  He's casting our boat loose!"
gasped Nat.
</p>

<p>
As he made this discovery the boy was too
engrossed to notice that a puff of wind came over
the water.  In their activity, since they had been
on board, not one of them had thought to lower
the schooner's sails.  She heeled to the wind
which momentarily grew steadier and forged
gently ahead.  But of all this Nat&mdash;to his cost, as
we shall see later&mdash;was oblivious.
</p>

<p>
The discovery he had made of the nefarious
work the mysterious inhabitant of the schooner
was about had aroused his rage.
</p>

<p>
With an angry shout, he sprang forward, rifle
in hand, toward the midnight skulker.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing here?" he demanded,
with an angry inflection in his voice.
</p>

<p>
Then, as the figure switched around, he added,
leveling his rifle:
</p>

<p>
"Throw up your hands and don't dare to move.
I've caught you at last."
</p>

<p>
But, to his surprise, instead of remaining still,
the figure made a swift dash for him.  Before
he could make a move Nat, caught quite off his
guard, for he had not dreamed of opposition,
found the rifle whisked from his hands by a
herculean grasp and hurled overside.
</p>

<p>
The next instant those mighty arms had encircled
Nat himself.
</p>

<p>
The lad, despite his strength and activity, was
a child in that grip of steel.
</p>

<p>
He felt himself helplessly snatched from his
feet and the breath crushed out of his body.
</p>

<p>
This stifled his agonized cry for help.
</p>

<p>
In one dreadful flash of insight he saw that the
creature which now held him was hairy, unclothed,
and ferocious to a degree.  But while he
still perceived this subconsciously, struggling
vainly to free himself, his captor made a rush
for the rail of the schooner.
</p>

<p>
The next instant Nat felt himself hurtling
through the air, uttering a choked cry.
</p>

<p>
But his shout was drowned as the water closed
above his head.  His last recollection, as he sank,
was of a shrill and terrible cry mingling with
and overpowering his own appeal.  It was the
same cry that they had heard twice before, and,
for a third time, in the air above them.
</p>

<p>
Nat, who was a strong and self-possessed
swimmer, came to the surface almost at once
after his submersion and at once looked about for
the schooner.  But, to his horror, he now saw
what he had not observed before, and that was
that the vessel was moving quite smartly through
the water.
</p>

<p>
"Help!  Help!  Help!" shouted Nat, treading water.
</p>

<p>
But his cry was unheard.
</p>

<p>
In a perfect agony of fear and apprehension
as to his future fate, he watched the schooner slip
off into the now light-hanging mist and vanish!
</p>

<p>
The boy was alone in the Pacific solitude with
nothing but his own strength to rely on, and Nat
knew that long before he could be picked up his
powers would have been exhausted.  It was the
most trying moment of all his life, and Nat, as
we know, had faced grave perils in his career.
</p>

<p>
But the young Motor Ranger was in a position
in which thinking could accomplish
nothing&mdash;action was the thing.
</p>

<p>
Treading water, so as to conserve all his
strength, he looked about him.  For a brief
interval he had cherished a hope that he might
catch a glimpse of the "Nomad" in the now clearing
atmosphere.  But this hope proved to be a
chimera.  No trace of the power cruiser was to be
seen.
</p>

<p>
Nat gave a low groan.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what is going to become of me,"
he thought.  "If assistance does not soon arrive
from some quarter, it will be too late.  And yet
where can I look for aid?  Captain Akers, and
Joe, are both sound sleepers.  Unless that monster
should attack them, they may not awaken till
daylight.  By that time my body will be at the
bottom of the Pacific."
</p>

<p>
The boy gave way entirely to his gloomy
forebodings.  And there was a good excuse for Nat's
apprehension.  A swimmer's endurance is not
unlimited.  He had never tested his powers to the
uttermost in the water, but he was pretty sure
that if he was still on the surface when day broke
that he would be singularly fortunate.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly something bumped against the lad in
the darkness.
</p>

<p>
Nat gave a cry half of alarm.  For one instant
he thought of sharks and all that an attack by
those ferocious monsters would mean.
</p>

<p>
The next instant, however, he realized that
what had bumped him in the darkness was nothing
more nor less than a largish stick of timber.
Apparently it had once been a spar on some
castaway vessel.  But whatever its past history, Nat
hailed it with joy.  Seizing on it, he buoyed
himself up and felt greatly relieved, both mentally
and physically.  With this support under him, he
could remain on the surface much longer than
would otherwise have been possible.  His spirits
rose.  Perhaps, after all, he would be saved.  The
coming of the bit of wood had seemed providential,
but Nat, looking about him, now perceived
that its coming was not so accidental as it had
seemed.  The water all about him was thickly
strewn with logs and boxes and barrels.
</p>

<p>
Seemingly he was in some sort of current
which had attracted all this miscellaneous flotsam.
</p>

<p>
All at once the solution occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
The great Pacific Drift!
</p>

<p>
He was on the bosom of that mysterious current.
This could scarcely be doubted.  But the
thought brought with it a dismal sense of
isolation and depression.
</p>

<p>
Ships steered clear of the Drift.  There was
too much debris floating on its surface to suit
them.
</p>

<p>
That being the case he stood still less of a
chance of attracting the attention of some vessel
than he had first hoped.
</p>

<p>
With such unpleasant thoughts to bear him
company, Nat passed the night away, clinging to
his friendly log.  It was to its timely arrival that
he owed the fact that he was on the surface of
the ocean instead of being drowned from exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
The sun rose on an unclouded expanse of sea.
The water shone as bluely under the rays of the
luminary as did the sky.  A burning, intense
steel-like blue.
</p>

<p>
Nat, casting despairingly about for a sail, or
the sign of a ship, could meet with nothing to
mar the desolate monotony of the ocean wastes.
He seemed to be alone on the wide, spreading
waters.
</p>

<p>
As the sun rose higher it grew hotter.  All the
world seemed to be on fire.  The heat burned the
salt into Nat's drenched skin and caused him
excruciating pain.
</p>

<p>
By noon the lad, suffering intensely for lack of
water, was half delirious.  Floating out there in
the broad Pacific on a weed-grown, barnacled
log, he babbled of green shady groves and
running mountain streams.
</p>

<p>
He heard his voice rattling on in its delirium
with the detached interest of a person listening
to somebody else.
</p>

<p>
Yet he knew it was himself talking in that
rambling, foolish way.
</p>

<p>
"I must be going crazy!" he gasped.  "Oh,
heaven! for one drop of cold water."
</p>

<p>
He raised his eyes and beheld, coming toward
him, something that almost made him release his
grip of the log from sheer astonishment.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
LOST ON THE WESTERN SEA.
</h3>

<p>
Not a hundred yards from him, and bobbing
gently up and down on the long swells, was a
small boat.
</p>

<p>
"If I can only get on board her, I'll be far
better off than I would be here," muttered Nat to
himself.
</p>

<p>
He kicked out vigorously and was soon alongside
the drifting shallop.  There was something
strangely familiar about her looks to him.  As
he climbed on board her, by way of the stern, he
soon saw why.
</p>

<p>
It was the collapsible boat which they had put
overboard from the "Nomad" and the same one
which he had detected the mysterious enemy of
the "Island Queen" in the very act of casting
loose.  Seemingly that individual had achieved
his malicious purpose and the boat, caught in the
Pacific Drift, had slowly been drawn along in
the mile-wide current of debris and flotsam.  The
chance was a providential one for Nat, at all
events.
</p>

<p>
As will be recalled, the boat had been stocked
up with provisions and a water keg put on board
by the party marooned on the mysterious schooner.
The first thing Nat made for was that keg.
It was the work of an instant to turn the spigot
and place his mouth to the refreshing stream that
gushed forth.  True, the water was warm, almost
hot, in fact, but to Nat no nectar, brewed
on high Olympus itself, could have tasted more
delicious.  He drank and then paused for breath
and then, applying himself afresh to the spigot,
he drank again.
</p>

<p>
The boy kept this up till his thirst was fully
quenched, and then he turned his attention to the
eatables.  Luckily all the canned stuff was fitted
with patent keys, so that no can opener was
needed.  The bag of ships biscuit contained all
that was wanted in the way of bread.  Nat
thought, as he ate, that he had never tasted a
more delicious meal.
</p>

<p>
When he had finished he gave a sigh of repletion
and looked about him.  The sea was still as
empty as the sky.  But the sun had sunk lower
and the heat was not so intense.
</p>

<p>
As he gazed about him, over that vast, lonely
expanse, Nat's apprehensions&mdash;lulled for a
time&mdash;returned tenfold.  If he was not picked up, what
would become of him?
</p>

<p>
He shuddered as he realized what his fate was
likely to be.  When his food and water were
exhausted he would drift till death overtook him.
Perhaps months, and maybe years, afterward his
body, dried by the heat, would be found adrift on
the Pacific and form another of those "ocean
mysteries," of which Captain Akers had told.
</p>

<p>
The thought was not a cheerful one and Nat
tried to busy his mind with other thoughts.  What
were they doing on board the "Nomad"?  What
would they be thinking on the schooner?  What
of the mysterious man, of giant strength, to
whose vindictive action he owed all his present
trouble?
</p>

<p>
"It's a queer situation all around," thought
Nat.  "Here am I on the ocean in a rowboat.  Joe
and Captain Akers are marooned on a schooner,
filled with mystery, and the 'Nomad' is crippled
and drifting about some place, under sail.  Shall
we ever all meet again, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
So the afternoon passed and the sun grew lower
and set.  Night rushed down over the sea with
all the swiftness characteristic of those latitudes.
Nat, his head sunk in his hands, allowed his boat
to drift.  He had oars, but, he felt, what was the
use of using them?  One way was the same as
another to him in his predicament.  Let the boat
drift at her will.
</p>

<p>
But by and by the darkness and the inaction
got on his nerves.  Picking up the oars, he fell to
work feverishly, trying to forget his troubles in
the work.  The boat fairly cut along.  For some
hours he kept this up and then, worn out, he cast
himself on the bottom of his craft and sank into
a deep sleep.
</p>

<p>
He was awakened by a sharp tug at his sleeve.
Starting up, Nat heard the loud swish of wings.
In the darkness he could dimly make out a huge,
winged form making off through the air.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!" he exclaimed, with a shudder, "that
was some bird of prey that concluded that I was
dead.  It was about to make a meal off me if I
had not moved."
</p>

<p>
Nat shook nervously as he realized that, if
some way was not found out of his predicament
before long, he would in very truth be food for
just such birds.
</p>

<p>
The thought bestirred him to action.  He sat
bolt upright and gazed about him.  But nothing
that he could perceive within his limited radius of
view appeared to give him hope.  The night was
as silent as the sea.  Overhead the stars burned
steadily and with a soft intensity not seen in the
east.
</p>

<p>
As he gazed up at them a sudden thought was
born in Nat's brain.  He threw himself on his
knees on the bottom of the boat and, clasping his
hands, he besought his Maker to look down in pity
upon him.  His heart seemed lightened as he
prayed.
</p>

<p>
When he had finished he looked about him
once more.  At first everything seemed to be the
same as when he had withdrawn his gaze; but,
after a minute, he perceived that on the
far-distant horizon something unusual was showing.
A dull, red glow.
</p>

<p>
As he gazed it grew brighter and spread till
it seemed to light up the whole sky.  The
atmosphere burned blood-red with the light.
</p>

<p>
"A ship on fire!" thought Nat.
</p>

<p>
Then came the idea:
</p>

<p>
"If so, some of her crew have likely escaped
and taken to the boats.  I'll row over toward
them.  They say 'misery loves company.'  I'm
sure I shall be glad to fall in with any one to
whom I can talk and who can possibly guide me
to some place of safety."
</p>

<p>
So thinking, Nat fell to his oars and began
pulling, with might and main, for the distant
glow.
</p>

<p>
But distances at sea are deceptive.  It seemed
to him he had pulled at least five miles when he
gave a second glance over his shoulder at the
fiery sky.
</p>

<p>
To his disappointment, the blaze seemed to be
as far off as ever.  Nat knew, however, that this
could not be the case, and, bending to his oars
once more, he pluckily pulled onward.  He was
rewarded, in a few minutes, by finding the light
growing visibly stronger and the blaze closer to
hand.
</p>

<p>
As yet, however, he had seen no boats, nor
traces of refugees from the burning ship&mdash;such
as he surmised the glow must be caused by.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe they are all waiting near by to see the
last of their vessel," thought Nat.  "In that case
I must hurry up or she'll have burned to the
water's edge before I arrive."
</p>

<p>
But when Nat had drawn quite close the blaze
was still burning fiercely.  The flames were
shooting up skyward, dimming the stars and making
a grand spectacle.  Fountains of sparks soared
heavenward as every now and then some beam
subsided with a crash.  Nat could hear the
hissing of the water as charred embers fell
overboard.
</p>

<p>
What rig the vessel had been was, of course,
impossible for the boy to make out, for when he
arrived within a short distance of her she was
already burned down to a mere hulk.  Her masts
and upper works had vanished some time before,
a prey to the savage flames.
</p>

<p>
All at once a hail came across the waters.
</p>

<p>
"Boat ahoy!"
</p>

<p>
To Nat it seemed that he must be in a dream.
It could not be possible that the voice he heard
was Joe Hartley's, and yet it was mighty familiar.
</p>

<p>
Again came the hail.  This time there was no
question about it.  It was Joe, though how he
happened to be there Nat had no idea.  Half
stunned by astonishment, he hailed back:
</p>

<p>
"Joe&mdash;old fellow&mdash;is it really you!"
</p>

<p>
"Sure enough, Nat," cried the voice, while a
cheer, given in hearty American style, rang out
over the crimsoned waters.
</p>

<p>
At the same instant, from the midst of the
intense glare, which had hitherto prevented Nat
from seeing any distance, glided the well-known
form of the "Nomad."  Nat came near fainting a
second time from sheer surprise as he saw her,
for the power-craft was not under sail, but came
gliding swiftly on, evidently running under motor
power.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later he was on board and after a
perfect tempest of congratulations, handshakings
and questions had been bandied about, Joe
explained it all.
</p>

<p>
After Nat had been missed from the "Island
Queen," they naturally suffered most intense
anxiety on his behalf.  What made it all the more
puzzling was that the boat was missing also.  But
right then they had troubles of their own on
hand as well as Nat's strange disappearance.  It
will be recalled that the two were asleep when
Nat was hurled overboard from the schooner and
they did not&mdash;as Nat had surmised would be the
case&mdash;awaken till some time later.
</p>

<p>
When they did so it was to find Nat gone and
the schooner staggering along, at a lively gait,
under all sail.  Luckily Captain Akers recalled
that he had seen some navigating instruments in
the cabin of the "Island Queen."  As the bearings
of the "Nomad" had been taken the day before,
it was a simple matter by figuring out their then
position to sail the schooner back to where they
had left her&mdash;simple, that is, so far as the
mathematical part of the proposition went.
</p>

<p>
But the "sailor part" of it was different.  Luckily,
however, the wind did not increase in violence
and, leaving the helm to Joe, Captain Akers
managed to get the vessel about.  To their huge
delight, they found that the good sense of Captain
Nelsen had prevented the "Nomad" being moved
in search of them, as had been the wish of the
others left on board.  Captain Nelsen,
however, had argued that they had better stop
right in that position, or as nearly so as
possible, in case Captain Akers did find&mdash;as proved
to be the case&mdash;his way back again.
</p>

<p>
The "Nomad" and the schooner were then
coupled together by means of grappling irons and
amid general rejoicing&mdash;which was sadly marred
by the news of Nat's vanishment&mdash;the work of
transferring her cargo of kerosene to the
"Nomad" was begun.  While it went on Sam Hinckley,
skillfully mended up the fuel tanks and, after
they were declared tight, they were filled.  The
engine was started and was found to work
perfectly on the stuff, as, in fact, the builders had
assured Captain Akers it would.
</p>

<p>
"So there we were, all ready to go onward once
more, but without you we could not and would
not proceed," said Joe, throwing his arm about
Nat's shoulders as the latter sat beside him on
the "Nomad's" bridge, the glow of the fire still
lighting up the scene.
</p>

<p>
"But, Joe," exclaimed Nat, "you haven't yet
told me the most interesting part of all this.
What vessel is that on fire?  And what has
become of the mysterious sailor?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming to that," said Joe.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you had begun there," laughed Nat,
"considering that the rascal threw me overboard."
</p>

<p>
"Listen and you will hear his fate," said Joe,
with a grandiloquent air.  Nat hung on his words
as the lad proceeded.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE ISLAND.
</h3>

<p>
"Know then," went on Joe, still keeping up his
oratorical pose and gestures, "that yon blazing
wreck is none other than the good schooner
'Island Queen'&mdash;or, rather, it was the 'Island
Queen.'  On board her are the charred remains
of the mysterious sailor who caused us so much
trouble and scared me out of seven years' growth
when he grabbed up that potato pan."
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!" exclaimed Nat, in a shocked
tone.  "You talk about the death of the poor
fellow as if it was not a thing to be serious over."
</p>

<p>
To his astonishment, the others broke into a
laugh at this.
</p>

<p>
"Well, of all the cold-blooded, unfeeling&mdash;&mdash;"
began Nat indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  Ha!  Ha!" laughed Joe, while Nat
glowered at him wrathfully.  "Don't waste any
sympathy on the ruffian, Nat."
</p>

<p>
"Say, this is going too far," burst out Nat.
"Do you mean to say that you let the poor fellow
perish without making any effort to aid him?  No
matter what he had done he was a fellow being&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If the Darwinian theory is true, that is," put
in Captain Akers quietly, but meaningly.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  What is the&mdash;&mdash;" began Nat, but Joe
saw that the matter had gone far enough and put
him out of his suspense.
</p>

<p>
"Why, that thing wasn't a man at all, Nat,"
chuckled Joe; "it was a monkey!"
</p>

<p>
"What!"
</p>

<p>
"That's right.  A big orang-outang from one
of the northern islands of the Malay peninsula,
probably," put in Captain Akers.
</p>

<p>
"And he is dead in the flames?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, in the flames he kindled himself," put in
Joe.  "You see, it was shortly before dark when
we had all the kerosene transferred, but it was
dim enough for us to need a light in the hold to
work by.  When all the stuff was out&mdash;or, rather,
all that we needed of it&mdash;we came on deck for a
breath of air.
</p>

<p>
"Hardly had we emerged from the hold before
the great ape came leaping and bounding from
forward.  It clambered over the bow, so we
conjectured that it must have hidden itself in the
figure-head, or the bow carving, while we were
searching for our mysterious annoyer.  At any
rate, as soon as we got a fair and full view of
it, we knew it for what it was.
</p>

<p>
"It eluded us, when it saw we were in no mood
to fly from it, and swung itself down into the
hold.  In a rage or panic, I don't know which, it
seized up the lamp and smashed it.  Instantly the
oil-soaked wood blazed up and we lost no time in
getting overboard.  The last we heard of the
orang was a repetition of the terrible cry that had
so alarmed us on board the schooner.  It evidently
perished in the flames."
</p>

<p>
"Poor creature," said Nat.  "I suppose it was a
ship's pet and was left on board when the crew
deserted their ship."
</p>

<p>
"You've no reason to feel so bad about it," put
in Joe.  "The animal came almost costing you
your life."
</p>

<p>
"But I owed it a good turn for casting loose
that boat," said Nat.  "If it hadn't been for that,
I would not be alive now."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," agreed Captain Akers soberly.
"That fire also was a blessing in disguise, for if
it had not occurred you would have had no means
of finding us."
</p>

<p>
The others agreed that it was indeed a
fortunate accident that had happened.
</p>

<p>
Soon after, as there was no occasion to linger
about the scene of the destruction of the "Island
Queen," the engine was started, on its new fuel,
and the "Nomad" sped off.
</p>

<p>
Her course was south of west.  There were
light hearts on board as she cut her way along&mdash;while
far behind her the last of the fire still
glowed redly.  After almost unparalleled setbacks,
they were once more on the sapphire trail.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Land ho!"
</p>

<p>
It was two months after the scene depicted
above that the look-out&mdash;Cal Gifford&mdash;uttered
the cry that thrilled the company of the gallant
little craft.
</p>

<p>
They all rushed on deck.  Nat and Captain
Akers from the cabin, in which they had been
bending over charts, Sam Hinckley from his
engines in company with Captain Nelsen, who had
been taking lessons in motor running, and
upon the bridge Joe Hartley and Ding-dong, who
had been dozing in the tropic noon, stirred into
galvanic life.
</p>

<p>
The land which Cal had spied was plainly visible.
A purple mist, like a small cloud, floating
on the western horizon.
</p>

<p>
Nat's voice thrilled as he turned to Captain
Akers and asked:
</p>

<p>
"Is it the Marquesas?"
</p>

<p>
"It should be," was the response.  "But I'll
take an observation and make sure."
</p>

<p>
The observation confirmed their belief that they
were at last in sight of their goal.
</p>

<p>
"We are now in latitude eight degrees south
and longitude one hundred and forty degrees
west.  Boys, this is a fine land fall," exclaimed
the captain enthusiastically.  "In all my years at
sea I never made a better."
</p>

<p>
In the midst of the general rejoicing, they none
of them noticed that Sam Hinckley alone looked
troubled.  The sight of the distant land seemed
to agitate him strangely.  Was it because he had
been there before at some period of his life and
held no pleasant recollections of it?  We shall
find out before long.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, we must explain the reason
for the "Nomad's" slow passage to the vicinity
of the islands.  In the first place at Honolulu,
where they had been compelled to put in for
provisions and fresh water, they had been held in
quarantine for some time, owing to a plague
scare.
</p>

<p>
The delay was the doubly aggravating because
they knew that all the time they were held there
the schooner "Nettie Nelsen"&mdash;a fast sailer, as
we know&mdash;was hastening at top speed for the
islands.  She, too, they heard, had put in at the
Hawaiian port and provisioned and watered, but
had gotten away again before the plague scare.
</p>

<p>
Other delays, caused by the manner in which
the kerosene carbonated the motor, had delayed
the "Nomad" also.  So much so, in fact, that the
burning question with those on board her was:
Would they be too late for the smart, two-masted
craft they were in search of?
</p>

<p>
There was no reason to suppose that, guessing
he would be pursued, Colonel Morello would elect
to linger long at the islands.  In fact, after
disposing of the schooner, the rascally crew would
probably split up and by devious routes make for
Australia.  If this had occurred before they
arrived at Ohdahmi, all the Motor Rangers' high
hopes were doomed to be blasted.
</p>

<p>
It was sundown when the "Nomad" at length
dropped anchor in a small, glassy bay off the
island which they believed to be Ohdahmi.  It was
a small spot of land, apparently, rising to a high
peak in the center.  The sides of this mountain,
and, in fact, the whole island, so far as they could
see, were clothed in vivid, tropical greenery,
forming a sharp contrast to the dull gray of the
volcanic rock composing the land.
</p>

<p>
The bay in which the "Nomad" was anchored
was almost landlocked.  Opposite to her a great
cliff shot up with a perfect cascade of tropical
plants falling down its face, at one point, in
regular festoons.  As their anchor chain rattled out,
clouds of birds flew up from the jungle and, after
flying about for a time with harsh screams,
settled down again for the night.
</p>

<p>
The boys were crazy to explore the vicinity
that night.  After their long period of
imprisonment in cramped quarters on board
the "Nomad," they were naturally desirous
of a run on shore.  Captain Akers, on being
consulted, agreed that there would be no harm in
the lads taking the boat and pulling about the
bay a bit; but he cautioned them not to land till
the morning, as the natives of the Marquesas,
while in the main peaceable enough, are
sometimes savage and treacherous.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the boys promised readily enough
and soon after, in the collapsible boat, they were
lowered over the side.  Nat, Joe Hartley, and
Ding-dong Bell, the original Motor Rangers,
comprised the party, the rest remaining on board.
</p>

<p>
With shouts of glee, they pulled for the great,
gray cliff-face.  The "stay at homes" leaned over
the rail and watched their progress through the
placid water till the boys neared the strange
cascade of greenery hanging down the acclivity like
a monstrous beard.  At that moment a shout
from Sam Hinckley, who had perceived some
strange fish overside, distracted their attention
for an instant.
</p>

<p>
When they looked up again, to their amazement
the boat had vanished.
</p>

<p>
They rubbed their eyes and looked and looked
again.  But of the vanished boat not a sign was
to be seen.  If the sea had opened and swallowed
it, it could not have disappeared more completely
from their ken.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this beats all!" exclaimed Captain
Akers.  "What can have become of it?"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE BOYS ENCOUNTER A BIG SURPRISE.
</h3>

<p>
To the boys in the boat, pulling away from the
anchored "Nomad," the island appeared a veritable
dreamland of beauty and fertility.  The gray
cliff-face, sheer and rugged, was topped by a
fairy-like growth of lofty palms and intertwining
creepers.  They could see fruits and flowers
of strange shapes and gorgeous hues shining
among the foliage.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this must be Utopia, all right," breathed
Joe.
</p>

<p>
"Wh-w-w-w-w-wherever that mar-mar-may
be," stuttered Ding-dong, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
"It's where folks talk straight," parried Joe,
which brought a laugh both from the good-natured
Ding-dong and from Nat, who was at the
oars.
</p>

<p>
"Say, let's take a look at that great mass of
creepers and stuff that hangs over the cliff-face,"
said Joe suddenly.
</p>

<p>
The others were nothing loathe.
</p>

<p>
"But we promised Captain Akers that we
would not land," reminded the dutiful Joe.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this won't be landing," temporized Nat,
who was fairly carried away with a desire to
examine this South Sea fairyland.
</p>

<p>
"That's so," agreed Joe; "well, row ahead and
put us alongside yon waterfall of fruits and
flowers."
</p>

<p>
"My, but you are per-per-poetical," snorted
Ding-dong.
</p>

<p>
"This place would make a goat poetical,"
retorted the other, as Nat, with some powerful
strokes, sent them flying over the still, lake-like
surface of the water, which reflected the cliff in
every detail, and into whose depths they could see
quite clearly.  Below them myriads of bright
colored fish sported and swam amid seaweed of
fantastic form and hue.
</p>

<p>
All this could be seen as if they were gazing
into a cool, green mirror.
</p>

<p>
But in a few minutes they were alongside the
tumbling mass of creepers.  Such was the impetus
of the boat, in fact, that Nat, who had not
been on the lookout, could not stop it.
</p>

<p>
"What ho, she bumps!" shouted Joe, steadying
himself in preparation for the coming shock.
But, to his astonishment, the boat, instead of
bumping into the creepers with a hard shock,
passed clean through them.
</p>

<p>
In an instant they found themselves shut out
from the open lagoon or bay behind them, and
were floating in a deep sort of lake, hemmed in
by high cliffs.  This was screened from the sea
by what may well be termed a natural drop
curtain&mdash;to wit, the hanging mass of creepers
through which the boat had passed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, did you ever?" exclaimed Joe, as he
gazed about him.
</p>

<p>
"N-n-n-n-n-o, I ner-ner-ner-never," responded
Ding-dong, with deep conviction.  His tones
echoed back solemnly from the amphitheater of
cliffs that towered on every side of them, their
rough faces being reflected as in a looking-glass
by the still water.
</p>

<p>
It was at this moment that consternation over
their disappearance was at its height on board
the "Nomad."  But, boy-like, the lads did not
consider this.
</p>

<p>
"Let's explore this place a bit before we go
back," suggested Nat, who had noted that the
lake narrowed at its farther end to a river,
which flowed at the bottom of a narrow and
deep gorge.
</p>

<p>
He fell to on his oars once more and the boat
was soon traversing the depths of the gloomy
abyss.  All at once the cleft in the rocks widened
and they emerged upon another lake.
</p>

<p>
And right here the biggest surprise any of them
had ever encountered awaited them.
</p>

<p>
Anchored in the middle of the landlocked body
of water was a schooner.
</p>

<p>
On her stern the boys had hardly finished reading
the name "Nettie Nelsen," before a fresh surprise
almost overwhelmed them.
</p>

<p>
From behind them there suddenly sounded a
harsh voice, which Nat, at least, knew only too
well:
</p>

<p>
"Well!  Well!  Some really welcome visitors!"
</p>

<p>
They turned to face the hawk-like features of
Colonel Morello, who stood on the banks of the
lake.
</p>

<p>
By his side was Dayton, while behind them
several other ill-favored members of the band hung
about.  The first thing that Nat noticed was that
Colonel Morello held a leveled rifle pointed
straight at him.  The next was that Dayton held
the same position and that the trigger fingers of
both were in a position instantly to discharge
their weapons.
</p>

<p>
"I rather think you had better come ashore,
boys," cooed the half-Mexican rascal in his silkiest
tones.  "To descend to slang, it looks to me
rather as if we had the drop on you."
</p>

<p>
Nat could not but admit it.  He cast one
despairing glance about him and saw that escape
was impossible.  With a face that was rather
paler than was its wont, he took up the oars, and
a few minutes later Morello's band had laid hold
of the prow of the boat and were dragging it up
on the beach.  Some of them laid rough hands
on the boys as they stepped out, but Morello's
voice checked them.
</p>

<p>
"Steady, boys, steady," he ordered; "plenty of
time to even up our scores with the young
ne'er-do-wells.  Ha!  Ha!  It was really amusing the
way you boys just walked into our trap," he went
on.  "We sighted your craft approaching the
island some time ago, but we had hardly prepared
to receive you before to-morrow, and now," he
went on in the same taunting tone, "as it is
getting dark let us make our way to my humble
residence, where to-night you will be accommodated
with lodgings.  After to-morrow you will not
need them," he added, with savage emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Morello," said Nat, in a steady voice,
"I think you are the biggest scoundrel I ever
saw."
</p>

<p>
"Really you compliment me," rejoined the ruffian,
with a hideous leer.  "Now, boys," he went
on, addressing his followers, "just march these
young cubs up to the camp.  To-morrow we'll get
the rest of the precious party and then we'll take
a trip to Australia in their gasolene cruiser&mdash;eh,
Dayton?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess that's the program, colonel," smiled
the rascal addressed.  "Oh, there's no question
about it but that Master Trevor here has proven
a very accommodating youth."
</p>

<p>
The others chuckled loudly at this sally.  Nat's
blood boiled within him.  Joe's cheeks flamed
angrily, while Ding-dong looked daggers at the
scoundrel.  But so far as making reprisals went,
the Motor Rangers were as powerless as kittens.
</p>

<p>
This time Morello undoubtedly would not give
them even the shadow of a chance to escape.
Their situation appeared well-nigh hopeless to
all but Nat.
</p>

<p>
With every reason to feel despondent&mdash;nay,
hopeless&mdash;the lad determined to keep his eyes
open in the rather vain hope that something
might turn up which they could seize upon to
advantage.
</p>

<p>
But when they reached the camp, after some
half hour of traversing a rough, stony section of
the island, thickly strewn with boulders and
intergrown with coarse grass and brush, he had to
own that the prospects of escape were, to say the
least, not at all numerous.
</p>

<p>
The camp was located in the bottom of a sort
of deep dell, leading up from the lake, and was
evidently on the edge of a plantation, at least, so
the boys judged from the orderly way in which
the trees were planted out.  As for the camp
itself, it consisted of a collection of tents and huts,
roughly made from limbs of trees and roofed with
branches.  But in that mild climate such
protection was ample.
</p>

<p>
To Nat's surprise, as they approached this
camp, from among the tents and rough shacks,
a strange figure to be met with under the
circumstances advanced to meet them.  It was the
figure of a tall American, in white duck and
wearing a broad-brimmed Jippa Jappa hat.  His feet
were encased in sandals, and about his waist was
a red sash.  An inky black beard grew about
the lower part of his face.  Perhaps it was there
to hide the cruel and sinister mouth.  For the
rest he was tall, had a commanding carriage and
seemed to be considerably above the social
station of the ruffians he was consorting with.
</p>

<p>
As he came forward, Morello addressed him.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Mr. Gooddale, well met.  We have
brought some visitors with us, as you will see.
They are young rascals who are in the pay of
the United States government to spy on honest
traders in the South Seas."
</p>

<p>
The amazing effrontery of such a misstatement,
for whatever purpose it was uttered, fairly
took Nat's breath away.  He could say nothing,
but stood looking at the newcomer, who, in turn,
stared at the boys.
</p>

<p>
Then he spoke in a rasping, unpleasant voice.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Morello, you must do as you wish with
them.  It is not my affair at all, but from what
you have told me of them I think that such lads
are better out of harm's way."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," rejoined Morello, "and now, if you
please, I will have them placed somewhere where
they will be safe for the night.  One of them
particularly is a very slippery youth," casting a
lowering glance at Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please, Morello," responded the
other listlessly.  "You must have your way, I
suppose.  At any rate, Elias Gooddale will not
oppose you."
</p>

<p>
"Elias Gooddale!" exclaimed Nat, startled out
of his resolve to keep silent whatever might happen.
</p>

<p>
The black-bearded man bent a piercing gaze
upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, young man, that is my name," was his
response.
</p>

<p>
"That is queer," rejoined Nat, who scented
some mystery; "the last time I encountered any
one of your name was in a hut in the Sierras."
</p>

<p>
The other started and turned pale.
</p>

<p>
"In the Sierra Nevadas, you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"That's it&mdash;yes.  He was a miner there.  We
visited his hut."
</p>

<p>
With still more agitation, the other went on:
</p>

<p>
"This is a most extraordinary thing.  A man of
the same name as myself.  Strange&mdash;very."
</p>

<p>
But Nat shrewdly saw that the other's
agitation proceeded from some deeper-seated cause
than his surprise at a similarity in names.
</p>

<p>
"What did he say to you?" asked this new
Elias Gooddale eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," responded Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," echoed the other.  "Don't trifle
with me, boy.  Did he not say something about
righting a wrong?  Did he not say anything?"
</p>

<p>
Nat shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"The Elias Gooddale we knew had been dead
some time when we discovered his body," he
rejoined.
</p>

<p>
The black-bearded man gave an exclamation of
amazement and consternation.  He regarded Nat
more closely than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Clearly," thought the boy, "I have stumbled
on some tangle that may be of use to us."
</p>

<p>
As the other plied him with more questions, he
resolved to be as secretive as possible.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
ATTACKED BY MARQUESANS.
</h3>

<p>
But for some purposes of his own, Morello, on
a whispered word from Dayton, brought the
examination to an abrupt conclusion.  The boys
were then, on Morello's orders, bound closely
with fiber ropes, and after being hustled into a
thick grove of dark-leaved bread-fruit trees in
the back of the camp, were thrown into a hut
made of pliant strands of some sort of bark,
interwoven with bamboo uprights.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of the hut apprised Nat at once
that it was of native manufacture.  Evidently,
then, this island either at the present time or at
some remote period, had provided a living place
for native tribesmen.  The lad wondered if any
of them were on it now, or if they had either
fled or been wiped out before the white man.
</p>

<p>
Even in the dangerous predicament in which
he and his companions were now placed, Nat
could not help speculating as to the connection
between this Elias Gooddale of the South Seas and
the dead miner of the same name, whose hoard
of sapphires had brought them into this strange
maze of adventures.
</p>

<p>
The other Motor Rangers, too, were puzzled
by the strange phase the case had assumed.  But
they could hit on no explanation.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I had that tin box with the papers
we found in the hut," thought Nat.  "I never
read them all through.  I wish I had now, for
perhaps among them might be some document
that would throw light on the matter."
</p>

<p>
But the consideration of their grave danger
soon drove all thoughts but those of the immediate
present out of the lad's head.  At about eight-thirty,
as well as he could judge, the two men who
had been placed to guard them were relieved by
two others, who brought with them the lads'
suppers.  These consisted of dried fish and rice, with
water as a beverage.  Their hands were released
while they ate, but before long their guardians
retied them, strapping them close to their sides in
a manner that made all hope of working them
loose seem futile.
</p>

<p>
The two men who had "relieved guard" were
both stout, stockily built men, roughly dressed.
Owing to the heat, they had discarded the
garments they had worn when in the Sierras, and
now were attired only in light canvas trousers,
seemingly made from sail cloth, and sleeveless
undershirts.  After the boys had been fed and
re-manacled, the two sentries, with their rifles
between their knees, took up their positions at the
door of the hut.  They conversed in low tones and
much of their conversation was audible to the
boys.
</p>

<p>
"I, for one, say to blazes with this way of
living," said one of them, in a grumbling tone.
"When are we going to clear out for Australia,
as Morello promised?"
</p>

<p>
"That depends on him," rejoined the other.
"He ain't the one to give his plans away.  Looks
as if he and this Gooddale had something between
them."
</p>

<p>
"It does that for a fact," was the reply, "and
by the same token this Gooddale is a puzzle to me.
Who is he, anyhow?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, beyond the fact that he owns a plantation
down here, and seems to be an old pal of
Morello's, it's hard to figger out.  I reckon he's
a mystery.  One thing I know, he wasn't sorry
when we arrived.  These natives at the other end
of the island had been invading his plantations
pretty regular.  From what I've heard, they
threatened to attack him in war canoes if
something&mdash;money, I guess&mdash;wasn't forthcoming
before long."
</p>

<p>
"Phew!" whistled the other.  "I hopes them
natives don't take it into their fuzzy heads to
attack the ranch while we are here.  I've heard
they are savage fighters and give no quarter."
</p>

<p>
"That's right, I guess.  However, from all that
I can hear, they ain't likely to get ugly so long
as we are about.  Figger out we're too strong a
party for them, I guess.  Don't know as I blame
them for being sore on this Gooddale, either.
From all I can hear, he treated them badly when
first he settled on the island, and now they are
just bent on making him pay for it."
</p>

<p>
"And if he won't give up?"
</p>

<p>
"In that case I guess they'll take it out of his
hide.  In other words, raid the place and do all
the damage they can."
</p>

<p>
"But don't the French gunboats patrol around
here pretty regular?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess so.  But they couldn't spare the men
or the time to send expeditions inter the interior
of the islands.  The natives know every path and
trail.  It might take months to punish them, so
they have things pretty much their own way."
</p>

<p>
"It sure looks like that," agreed his companion.
"But how about having a pull at that Pisco bottle?"
</p>

<p>
"Here it is," rejoined the other, apparently
producing some sort of bottle and passing it to his
companion.
</p>

<p>
"Ah-h-h-h-h-h, that was good," breathed one
of the voices, after an interval.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you want to be careful how much you
drink of it," was the answer.  "It's fiery stuff, all
right.  They say that it has been the ruin of the
natives down here."
</p>

<p>
"Comes from Peru, don't it?"
</p>

<p>
"That's right.  But hark!&mdash;what in the name
of the Old Harry is that?"
</p>

<p>
The boys, who had listened to this conversation
with interest, wondered, too, what a sudden
commotion in the direction of the camp might
betoken.
</p>

<p>
Shouts, cries, and imprecations arose on the
night air.  Presently a fusillade of shots rang
out.
</p>

<p>
"We're attacked!" shouted one of the men outside
the hut.  "Come on!  Let's get over there!"
</p>

<p>
The next instant their retreating footsteps
could be heard.  In the meantime, the clamor and
shooting had redoubled.  Evidently whatever was
occurring was marked by severe casualties, for
the boys could hear groans and cries of pain
mingling with the shouts of the fighters.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever can be happening?" gasped Joe.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds as if our friends, Colonel Morello's
men, were getting the worst of it, anyway,"
declared Nat.  "Hark!"
</p>

<p>
Savage cries with a triumphant ring to them
could be heard, accompanied by a sort of
war-like dirge.
</p>

<p>
"It's the natives!" cried Nat, his doubts cleared
away by this last.
</p>

<p>
"They've attacked the camp!" cried Joe.
</p>

<p>
"Wer-wer-will they get after us?" gasped
Ding-dong through the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible to say," was Nat's rejoinder.  "All
we can do is to hope not.  I don't know, though,
that we should be worse off in their hands than
in the clutches of Colonel Morello."
</p>

<p>
"If only we could get free of these ropes, we
could escape in the excitement," exclaimed Joe.
"Oh, what wouldn't I give for a knife!"
</p>

<p>
"Mer-mer-uch good it would do you wer-wer-when
you can't use your hands," scoffed Ding-dong
Bell scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"That's so," agreed Joe, somewhat crestfallen.
"There's nothing we can do, is there?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing except to wait," declared Nat, "and
that's the hardest thing in the world."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the door of the hut flew open and a
figure dashed in.  It was pitch dark or Nat would
have recognized it as one of their guards of a
few minutes before.  The fellow was wounded,
seemingly, for he gave a groan and pitched forward
as he entered the hut, which, as it was some
distance from the main camp, he had evidently hit
upon as a good hiding place.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he moaned, in the darkness, "I'm wounded.
Oh, somebody please tie up my shoulder."
</p>

<p>
A sudden idea struck Nat.
</p>

<p>
"I'd bandage it for you if I was free," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"That's so," groaned the man; "you are bound,
ain't you?  But say, I kin use my left hand a bit
and maybe I can cut you free.  But will you
promise to bandage my shoulder to prevent more
blood flowing, if I do so?"
</p>

<p>
This was what Nat hoped for, and he readily
agreed to do as the injured man requested.  In
a few seconds he felt the fellow's left hand
fumbling about for the ropes.  Presently, after
hacking a bit, he severed one.  It was one of the wrist
thongs.  With his hands free, the rest was easy
for Nat.  Taking the knife from the man, he cut
the rest of his bonds and then liberated his
companions.  In the meantime, the man, in broken,
disjointed sentences, had told them what had
happened.  Colonel Morello's band and Gooddale had
been taken totally by surprise by the natives and
had been utterly routed.  Many of them had
escaped to the schooner, but several were wounded
in the fight.
</p>

<p>
After he was free Nat did not forget his promise,
but tearing some strips from his shirt formed
a rough bandage, with which he managed to
assuage the flow of blood from the wounded man's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," breathed the fellow, as Nat
finished his ministrations, "I might have bled to
death if it hadn't a bin for you kids.  I'm glad
you are free and I hope you don't get caught by
them natives.  They are the worst looking bunch
I ever saw.  Most of 'em naked and painted, and
with big china door knobs and such stuff slung
about 'em, and great big spears."
</p>

<p>
Nat moved the water jar, which they had
drunk from at supper&mdash;if such the meal may
be called&mdash;closer to the wounded man and
dragged him to a corner of the hut.  There was
a pile of leaves there&mdash;the big, broad foliage of
the banana.
</p>

<p>
"Cover me with them," asked the man.
"They'll hide me if any of them natives comes ter
look in here."
</p>

<p>
Nat did this, and then, expressing a hope that
the injured man, who, after all, had done them a
good turn, would be all right, he and his
companions set out.
</p>

<p>
Freed from their captivity by what seemed almost
a miracle, they hesitated as they passed the
portal of the hut.
</p>

<p>
Which way should they go?
</p>

<p>
As they lingered a fresh chorus of savage
howls broke out on the air from the direction of
the camp.  At the same instant a faint illumination
glowed upon the night.  It spread and glared
up fiercely, tinting the skies as it flamed higher.
</p>

<p>
To complete their work of devastation, the
savages had fired the camp.  From their howls and
cries, they were dancing about it.
</p>

<p>
"Which way shall we go?" asked Joe, voicing
the question in the hearts of all.
</p>

<p>
"I vote for the lake," said Nat.  "Maybe we
can find a boat there and make our way through
the ravine and back to the 'Nomad.'"
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, skirting cautiously through the
tropical growth, they made for the direction in
which they judged the lake lay.  The glare of the
burning camp lit their path with a weird radiance,
as they pushed onward.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
A STRANGE MEETING.
</h3>

<p>
They gained the shores of the "lake" at a point
a good distance removed from the vicinity of
Colonel Morello's camp.  But they no sooner
reached the shore than by the light of the flames
they perceived that, as the wounded man had
said, some indeed of the band must have eluded
capture or injury by the savages.
</p>

<p>
The two-masted schooner which had been the
theater of Nat's former thrilling adventures was
already in motion.  With canvas up, she was
heading for the mouth of the gorge.
</p>

<p>
Seemingly, the savages who had attacked the
camp must have been a land force, for, although
the boys could see several of them on the bank of
the lake in the neighborhood of the burning camp,
they made no effort to pursue the schooner.  But
as they watched her glide off they could be heard
to utter angry cries and shouts.
</p>

<p>
"Well, so far, it looks as if the schooner will
get off scot free," remarked Nat; "but what are
they going to do when they come to the gorge?
They can't sail her through that."
</p>

<p>
"Hardly," agreed Joe.  "I guess when they
reach it they will either tow her by boats or else
warp her through by casting out the anchor and
then pull in up on the cable."
</p>

<p>
The latter was, in fact, the means used by the
fugitives to get through the narrow gorge.  On
board her were Colonel Morello, Ed. Dayton, and
a dozen others, including Larsen, the giant Swede
who acted as the vessel's navigator.  They had
escaped from the village when it was attacked by
the natives and made straight for the banks of
the lake where they had embarked in the collapsible
boat brought by the boys and another small
craft which they had there.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the open sea, after pushing
through the curtain of greenery, the collapsible
boat was cast adrift.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the boys had circled a great
part of the lake in search of some sort of a boat
which they thought might have been left there by
either Gooddale or some of Morello's men.
</p>

<p>
All this took a long time, and it was close to
midnight when Nat, who was in advance of the
party, stopped and gave a cry of delight.  Ahead
of them on the white beach lay a canoe, turned
bottom upward.
</p>

<p>
"Hooray!" shouted Nat.  "With some branches
for paddles we can make good our escape in this,
all right.  Boys, suppose you go and cut some
limbs from those trees while I turn the canoe
over and get her in the water, and then
hooray! for the dear old 'Nomad.'"
</p>

<p>
Joe and Ding-dong, in a hurry to complete
their errand, plunged into the dense jungle in
search of suitable limbs, while Nat hastened to
the side of the canoe and turned it over.  As he
did so he got one of the most thrilling shocks of
his life.
</p>

<p>
From under the craft there leaped three hideous,
painted savages.  Their noses were transfixed
with wooden pegs, brass rings hung from
their ears, extending the lobes to an unnatural
size.  Round their necks hung strings of door-knobs,
old cartridges, and various other bits of
hardware.
</p>

<p>
They poised their spears threateningly at Nat
who stood transfixed with alarm and astonishment.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
They poised their spears threateningly at Nat who <br />
stood transfixed with alarm and astonishment.
</p>

<p>
The men formed part of an outlying system of
sentries, posted by the wily old chief of the tribe.
</p>

<p>
One of them clapped his hand to his lips as a
signal for silence, emphasizing his order by a
flourish of his spear.
</p>

<p>
But he need not have done so.  Nat knew that
to make an outcry would mean that Ding-dong
and Joe Hartley would come bounding to
his assistance.  In that case, they would be in as
grave a fix as he was.  So he remained silent
while his captors signaled to him to follow
them.
</p>

<p>
With one at his side and two spearsmen behind
him, Nat had no recourse but to obey.  As he
stumbled along, for the savages were stepping
out briskly, Nat found himself wondering what
Ding-dong and Joe would think when they returned
to the beach and found the canoe deserted.
He hoped they would have presence of mind
enough to waste no time in looking for him, but
make all haste to the "Nomad" and summon aid.
</p>

<p>
If they did this he might be able to stave off
harm till aid arrived.  But in case it did not, Nat,
foolishly perhaps, did not feel any immediate
apprehension.  His captors, while savage looking
and menacing, did not appear willing to offer him
any actual harm.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder where we are heading for?" thought
Nat, as they hastened along, skirting the shores
of the lake at the same brisk pace.
</p>

<p>
"I guess we are going back to the camp where
the chief must be.  In that case, it won't be long
before I know what is to be done with me.  If I
can only convince the savages that I am as much
an enemy of Gooddale and Morello as they are, I
may get off without any trouble."
</p>

<p>
Buoying up his spirits by such thoughts, Nat
stepped out as boldly as his captors, who from
time to time conversed with each other in
guttural monotones.
</p>

<p>
As Nat had surmised, their course was laid for
the still blazing camp.  At the pace they were
going they reached it far quicker than it had
taken the boys to traverse the distance to the
canoe, for the savages had no need to dodge in
and out of trees and shrubbery to avoid being
seen.
</p>

<p>
It was a wild and strange scene that met Nat's
eyes as he and his escort entered the burned camp.
Savages, all attired&mdash;or, rather, unattired&mdash;like
his captors were swarming everywhere.
</p>

<p>
They capered and danced about the ruins with
shrill cries.  Evidently they thought they had
accomplished an excellent night's work.  Here and
there Nat noted, with a shudder, some still forms
lying huddled and motionless.  He knew that
these must be the bodies of the victims of the
fight which followed when the camp was surprised.
</p>

<p>
Were Morello and Dayton among them, he
wondered, or had they escaped on the schooner
the lads had seen standing off down the lake?
</p>

<p>
In front of one of the burned huts a tall savage
stood, leaning on his spear.  The fire-light played
on his features and it struck Nat that the man
had a far more intelligent look than his
followers, at any rate those whom he had seen of
them.
</p>

<p>
It soon transpired that this savage was none
other than the chief of the tribe, or, at least, a
person of authority.  Nat was marched straight
up to him and an excited colloquy between the
chief and the men who had been lying under the
canoe at once began.  Other tribesmen came up
while it was in progress.  They gazed curiously at
Nat, but offered him no violence.  He wondered
what would come next.  He was not left long in
doubt.
</p>

<p>
The chief gave a wave of his hand and presently
Nat was led off once more.  This time he
was escorted to a grove of bread-fruit trees and
then his hands were strapped behind him around
one of the trunks.  He was a prisoner for the
second time that day, and, by a strange fatality, in
almost the same place as had been the scene of
his first captivity.
</p>

<p>
"This looks bad," muttered Nat, half aloud, as
the savages, having tied him, walked off again,
retracing their steps to the looted camp.  "Nat
Trevor, you'll need all your courage."
</p>

<p>
To his amazement, the next instant a voice
came out of the darkness, evidently not far from
him.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that who speaks of Nat Trevor?"
</p>

<p>
"Captain Akers!" exclaimed Nat.  "How in
the world did you get here?"
</p>

<p>
"Then it is you!" exclaimed the captain.  "This
is a most extraordinary meeting, Nat.  I fear that
we have about reached the end of our tether."
</p>

<p>
"Not by a long shot," chimed in another
familiar voice, which Nat recognized with delight
as being that of Cal Gifford.  "Nat and me has
been in as tough places and gotten out&mdash;ain't we,
Nat?"
</p>

<p>
"That's right, Cal," was the rejoinder.  "But
that isn't answering my question.  How did you
come to be here?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see," said Captain Akers, "when
you didn't come back we decided that something
serious must be wrong, and me and Cal set out
in the other boat to look for you.  It didn't take
us long to reach the spot where we had last seen
you and to discover that all that green stuff on
the cliff-face hid an opening.
</p>

<p>
"We guessed you must have entered it with
the boat and pulled through it.  Then we headed
up the gorge.  We soon emerged into that lake
yonder, and saw lights in the camp&mdash;or what
we later discovered was the camp.  Drawing the
boat up on shore, so as to half conceal her near
the bushes, we set out to reconnoiter.  We crept
through the jungle till we had gotten quite close
to the camp, and the first thing we heard was
the voice of that rascal Morello talking about how
neatly he had trapped you.
</p>

<p>
"You kin bet we was mad," put in Cal, "but
what could we do?  While we was figgering out
some way to find your place of imprisonment and
aid you, the attack on the camp came.  We tried
to get away, but a party of them niggers came
right up on us.  I guess that's about all, except
that here we are.  And now tell us your story."
</p>

<p>
Nat briefly related what had occurred to them
since they left the "Nomad."  His recital was
received with exclamations of astonishment by both
Cal and Captain Akers.  Both were likewise
much concerned over the predicament that both
Ding-dong and Joe must by that time be in.  They
had no doubt returned to the boat soon after Nat
and his captors had left it.  The question was,
would they paddle off for the "Nomad" or remain
where they were in the hope that Nat would return?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Cal scattered all meditations on this
subject by a sharp exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" asked Captain Akers
curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Nuthin' much, only I got my hands free,"
drawled Cal, in the most unconcerned manner.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
NAT'S SKYROCKET ARTILLERY.
</h3>

<p>
"The boat lies off in that direction.  We had
better make our way to her at top speed."
</p>

<p>
It was Captain Akers who spoke, fifteen minutes
later.  In that time Cal had wriggled out of
his own bonds and freed the others.  Our party
now stood in the shadows of the grove, while
clearly borne to them came the shouts and yells of
the still excited tribesmen.
</p>

<p>
"Once on board her we can institute a search
for Ding-dong and Joe," whispered Nat.  "They
cannot be so very far off, unless they pulled
direct for the gorge."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let's vamoose then, at once," struck in
Cal.  "No sense in lingering.  Those Kanakas
think we are tied too securely to bother with us,
but who knows that one of them might take a
notion into his ugly head at any minute to come
and look at us to make sure."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," agreed Nat.  "Lead the way
then, Captain, we will follow."
</p>

<p>
Without more ado the captain struck off into
the undergrowth, his two companions pushing
along behind him.  But as they plunged from the
clearing into the brush, as ill luck would have
it, Captain Akers' foot struck one of the savages
who had chosen that spot to take a quiet nap.
</p>

<p>
The fellow leaped to his feet with a yell that
rang echoing all about.  The next instant Captain
Akers' fist crashed into the man's face and he
measured his length.  But the mischief had been
done.  Like a pack of hounds in full cry, most of
the tribe came rushing toward the spot to
ascertain the cause of the outcry.
</p>

<p>
"Come on.  It's a run for life now!" panted the
skipper, dashing off.
</p>

<p>
The others followed as quietly as possible, but
still they could not avoid making some noise as
they traversed the tangle.
</p>

<p>
To men as keenly trained in the primitive
senses as the savages, it was thus an easy
matter to follow them.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven grant the boat is there or we are lost
men," breathed the captain, as they sped along
with the savage yells ringing out menacingly
behind them.  It was indeed, as the captain had
said, a run for life.
</p>

<p>
Before long they emerged from the vegetation
and found themselves once more on the lake
shore.
</p>

<p>
Captain Akers gave a groan as he looked about
him.
</p>

<p>
No boat was to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"We're done for," he gasped desperately.
</p>

<p>
"Look, what is that dark object up the beach
there!" exclaimed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Good for you, lad, I believe that is the boat!"
exclaimed the captain.  "I miscalculated our
whereabouts and gave her up for lost.  Come on!
Sharp's the word."
</p>

<p>
At top speed they fled along the sandy shore.
</p>

<p>
But an appalling din behind them told them
better than words that they had been seen.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes now would decide all.
</p>

<p>
Wh-i-z-z-z-z-z-z!
</p>

<p>
Something whistled by Nat's ear and sank
quivering in the ground just ahead of him.
</p>

<p>
It was a spear.  The boy shuddered as he
thought how narrowly the cruel weapon had
missed sinking between his shoulder blades.
</p>

<p>
The next instant they were at the boat's side.
But the tide had fallen since she was beached, and
to their consternation there was quite a distance
to push her before she would be afloat.
</p>

<p>
But they gritted their teeth and caught hold.
As they did so, Nat's hand encountered a box
lying by the gunwale of the craft.
</p>

<p>
"What in the world is that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," panted Cal, "that's the skyrockets.  I
brought them with the idea of signaling the
others if I found you."
</p>

<p>
"Hooray!" shouted Nat.
</p>

<p>
The others gazed at him in astonishment.  For
an instant they thought his mind had given way
under the strain of the past twelve hours.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" asked Captain Akers.
</p>

<p>
"The rockets&mdash;hooray!  We'll use them as
weapons against the natives!"
</p>

<p>
"By hookey, the boy is right!" exclaimed
Captain Akers.  "I once scared off a band of
Patagonians in that way when a ship I commanded
ran ashore."
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to look sharp," said Nat, taking
one of the rockets.  They were big ones, intended
for signaling at sea.  The sticks were already
fitted.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky that they will be just as effective skimming
over the ground as if they went straight up
in the air," exclaimed Nat.
</p>

<p>
He laid one in the bow of the boat, where it
came to a point, and lost no time in applying a
match to it.
</p>

<p>
As the flame blazed up a yell apprised him that
the savages, who had been baffled for an instant,
had sighted them.
</p>

<p>
With ferocious, blood-curdling cries, the
Polynesians charged on the boat, waving their
weapons in hideous significance.
</p>

<p>
"Yell away," gritted out Cal.  "You'll squall
louder yet in a minute, my pesky, yaller coyotes."
</p>

<p>
The first of the savages, a huge, gaunt fellow,
was within fifty feet of the boat when the rocket,
with a loud "fi-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z!" tore loose.
Straight as an arrow it sped, driven by its tail
of fire.
</p>

<p>
The next instant It struck the advancing savage
in the breast.  With a howl of terror, he fell
flat, and the rocket, deflected from its course,
went hissing and roaring like a devouring serpent
among his followers.
</p>

<p>
Before they could make a move to avoid the
mysterious fiery peril, it exploded with a terrific
"bang!"
</p>

<p>
Brilliantly colored globes of fire spattered from
it in all directions.  Red, green, and blue.  The
savages howled with terror and rage and
mystification.  This was a new method of warfare to
them.
</p>

<p>
"Hooray! we've got 'em going!" shouted Cal,
as the savage, whom the rocket had knocked over,
scrambled to his feet with surprising agility and
sprinted back among his brethren.
</p>

<p>
"That was shot Number One!" cried Nat, putting
another rocket in place and lighting the fuse.
Like the other, the second rocket sped straight
and true for the massed bodies of the aborigines.
Before they could recover from their surprise, it
was upon them.  Roaring and sputtering like a
fiery comet, it sped among their legs, sending
sparks and fire all over them.  As the brands fell
on their naked skins the savages broke into wild
yells and cries.  Panic reigned in their ranks.
</p>

<p>
In the light of the bursting star-case of the
rocket our party could see black forms darting
off into the bush in all directions.  The ordeal of
fire had proven too much for them.  They shouted
with fear as they ran helter-skelter in every
direction.
</p>

<p>
Our friends shouted, too, but with far different
emotions, as they shoved the boat over the
strip of sand between her and the water's edge.
In another minute they had her launched and
were off.  Cal took the oars and saw the light
craft flying across the smooth surface of the
lake.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Nat gave a cry.
</p>

<p>
"There's a canoe ahead there coming toward us!"
</p>

<p>
"By George, so there is!" cried Captain Akers.
"What if it is the forerunner of a fleet of
them?"
</p>

<p>
But there was no cause for such apprehension,
for the craft, in a few seconds more, proved to
be none other than the canoe beneath which Nat
had surprised the sleeping savages.  In it were
Joe and Ding-dong.  They had been profoundly
distressed at Nat's vanishment and their relief
when they heard his voice may be imagined.
</p>

<p>
They had seen the rockets while they were
disconsolately paddling about, waiting for daylight
to prosecute a search for their companions.
Rightly surmising that they were fired by
members of the Motor Ranger party, they at once
made for that direction.  They were little
prepared, however for the surprise that awaited
them.
</p>

<p>
The reunited party then all took places in the
"Nomad's" boat, towing the canoe astern.
</p>

<p>
A dull, gray dawn was just breaking as they
set out once more for the mouth of the gorge
that led to the sea.  Rapidly they neared it.  But
as they did so Nat, who was gazing toward the
shore, uttered a sudden cry of consternation.  The
others, following the direction of his gaze, could
see crowds of savages running along the beach.
</p>

<p>
"What can they be after?" shouted Joe.  "They
seem to have some object in mind."
</p>

<p>
"A terrible one, I am afraid," said Nat gravely.
He had guessed the meaning of the natives' haste.
</p>

<p>
"If I'm not mistaken&mdash;and I hope I am&mdash;they
are headed for the gorge.  They know we shall
have to pass through it to escape."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what then?"
</p>

<p>
The question came from Cal, who was not
particularly quick-witted, despite all his other
good qualities.
</p>

<p>
"What then?" echoed Nat.  "Why, if they get
there first, they can hurl rocks or spears down on
us and soon put us out of commission."
</p>

<p>
"What is to be done?" asked Joe, in a dismayed
voice.
</p>

<p>
"We must get to the gorge first."
</p>

<p>
"It will be a desperate race," put in Captain
Akers.
</p>

<p>
"And one in which the stakes are life or
death," was Nat's comment.
</p>

<p>
The canoe was cut loose so that they could
make better progress, and the boat fairly hissed
over the water.  But the natives of these islands
where there are no horses are prodigiously swift
runners.  They saw, to their dismay, that fast as
they rowed the natives ashore were as swift, or
perhaps a shade faster.
</p>

<p>
At last the entrance of the gloomy gorge
loomed in front of them.  Its sides towered
steeply, showing a thin strip of sky at the
summit.  Through this narrow passage they must
pass to win freedom.
</p>

<p>
The hearts of all beat faster as the boat
entered the shadows of the defile.  Nat's breath
came thickly and his heart beat fast.  Joe and
Ding-dong showed, too, by their white, set faces,
that they felt the strain painfully.  Captain Akers
sat in the stern with a composed face.  He had
looked on danger too often to tremble now.  Cal
was as unconcerned as ever, outwardly, but a
certain nervous twitching of his facial muscles
showed that even his iron nerve was shaken.
</p>

<p>
And small wonder.  A stone&mdash;not a very large
one, either&mdash;pitched from the top of the defile
would inevitably have sunk the boat.  The
impetus gained in its three-hundred-foot fall would
have given it a crushing force twenty times
superior to its own weight.
</p>

<p>
They had rowed perhaps a hundred feet into
the defile when Joe, who was gazing up at the
sharply defined edges, gave a cry and pointed.
</p>

<p>
Outlined against the sky far above them was a
brown-skinned figure.  It was joined by another
and another.  They gazed down at the boat,
gesticulating furiously.
</p>

<p>
"It's all off," groaned Cal tragically.
</p>

<p>
"We must keep on going and trust to Providence,"
decided Captain Akers.  "It would mean
death anyway if we turned back now."
</p>

<p>
The boat sped on and presently the figures
disappeared.  Had they gone to get rocks with which
to pelt the boat?  This was soon answered.
Before ten seconds had passed they were back again.
But this time, to the boys' horror, they saw that
the natives had a large stone which they were
rolling to the edge of the defile.  Their evident
intention was to drop it on the boat as it passed
beneath.
</p>

<p>
"Pull for your lives!" yelled Captain Akers.
"There's one chance in a hundred we may beat
them."
</p>

<p>
The boat shot forward in a desperate spurt.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment the natives trundled the
stone to the edge of the ravine.  For one instant
it trembled on the lip of the abyss, and then&mdash;it fell!
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily those in the boat crouched as
they saw what was coming.  But this time, at
least, fortune favored our friends, for the big
stone missed the boat by a fraction of an inch,
the force of its impact with the water sending up
great waves from the stern.
</p>

<p>
Before the savages, who had launched the
stone just one fraction of a second too late to
annihilate the boat, could recover their wits, the
lads were out of harm's way.  For the surface at
the summit of the cliff was covered with
underbrush and the savages, who were the advance
guard of the rest, could not hope to keep pace
with the boat through it.  A shower of spears
came after them, striking the water like hail.
But not one struck the boat.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later the boat traversed the
curtain of creepers and emerged upon the surface
of the open sea.
</p>

<p>
"Now for the 'Nomad'!" shouted Joe, as they
shoved through the suspended panoply.  But his
rejoicing was rather premature.
</p>

<p>
To their dismay, and no less astonishment, no
sign of the "Nomad" was to be seen.  As far as
the eye could reach the sea was empty of life as
the desert at noonday.
</p>

<p>
It was a bitter disappointment and for some
time not one of the party could find words to
convey the bitterness of his spirits.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
THE LAST OF THE "NETTIE NELSEN."&mdash;CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
But they had little time to brood over their
misfortune.  Hardly had they made the discovery,
in fact, before Captain Akers gave a low
exclamation and pointed seaward.  At first the boys
could see nothing but peculiar, wispy-looking
clouds floating near the horizon.
</p>

<p>
But even in the short time they gazed the
clouds became larger.
</p>

<p>
"Is bad weather coming?" asked Nat uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my lad, it is," was the grave reply.
"Those clouds yonder look to me like the
forerunners of a typhoon."
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!" exclaimed Nat, "and this
boat is overloaded as it is.  What are we to do?"
</p>

<p>
"My advice is to skirt along the coast till we
find a place to land and then run the boat ashore."
</p>

<p>
"But the shore may be swarming with savages,"
objected Nat.
</p>

<p>
The captain shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Can't be helped, my lad," he said, "and, after
all, we stand a better chance with the savages
than we do in this boat in a typhoon."
</p>

<p>
They could not help admitting that this seemed
true.  In even a moderate gale the lightly built
collapsible craft would not last long.  In one of
the savage typhoons of Polynesia she would be
sunk like a stone.
</p>

<p>
No time was lost therefore in getting out the
oars and starting to pull along the coast.
Acting on Captain Akers' recommendation, they
kept close in to the shore.  But they were not
rewarded by the sight of any good landing place.
On the contrary, Ohdahmi&mdash;like the other islands
of the Marquesas Group&mdash;rose precipitately from
the water, the cliffs towering steeply up from the
surface of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"What is that peculiar looking object over
there?" asked Nat suddenly.
</p>

<p>
He indicated a black thing bobbing about on
the water.  It was not so very far distant from
the boat and they all gazed at it with interest.
</p>

<p>
"It's a barrel!" exclaimed Captain Akers
presently, "and&mdash;really this is very curious&mdash;it has
two smaller barrels attached to each side so as
to keep it upright.  If it wasn't that bad weather
may be on us at any moment, I'd like to look into
this thing."
</p>

<p>
"It certainly looks peculiar," admitted Nat.
"Hark!" he broke off suddenly.  "I can hear
somebody singing!"
</p>

<p>
Sure enough, there came borne to their ears the
sound of a song, intoned in a not over musical
voice:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "My bonnie lies over the oc-e-a-n!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bonnie lies ov-er the sea!<br />
  My bonnie lies ov-er the ocean!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O-ho-o, bring back my bonnie to me!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Where on earth is it coming from?" gasped
Nat, glancing about.  He half suspected that
Ding-dong might be playing a trick.  But no, the
stuttering lad's face was puzzled as the
countenances of the others.
</p>

<p>
"It's coming from that barrel!"
</p>

<p>
The words came from Captain Akers.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" cried Nat.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sure about that," struck in Cal.
"I've got purty good ears, an' it certainly seems
to me that the singing is coming frum that keg."
</p>

<p>
"Ahoy there!" shouted the captain, determined
to put an end to the mystery once and for all.
"Who are you in that keg?"
</p>

<p>
"Ahoy!" came back the answer in ringing
tone, though somewhat muffled.  "I'm Sam
Hinckley, a marooned sailor.  Who&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Sam got no further.  With vigorous
strokes the boat was pulled alongside, while the
Motor Rangers and their chums shot out volleys
of questions.  The barrel was quickly secured
alongside and the top, after some difficulty,
broken in with an oar butt.
</p>

<p>
The next instant Sam, rather pale and wan
looking, but otherwise seemingly not much the
worse for his ordeal, emerged from it.  As soon
as he was somewhat recovered, and the boat once
more under way, he related his story.  As they
had suspected, the placing of Sam in the barrel
had been one of Morello's devices and came
about in this way.
</p>

<p>
After Captain Akers and Cal had left the "Nomad"
in search of the lads, Sam and Captain Nelsen
took watch and watch about, waiting for
something to transpire.
</p>

<p>
Sam was on watch in the early morning when,
through the darkness, he saw the dark outline of
the schooner&mdash;which, it will be recalled, had
slipped out of the landlocked lake&mdash;heading
toward them.  Presently she came to anchor and
stopped.  A boat was lowered and several men,
all armed fully, clambered into it.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Sam had summoned Captain
Nelsen from his berth.  But the veteran mariner
was as unable as Sam to devise a means of coping
with the situation.  His advice was not to resist,
which, in the long run, would have been useless,
but to cut and run for it.  In accordance with this
resolve, Sam went below, while Captain Nelsen
got up anchor.
</p>

<p>
The next instant the "Nomad" was moving
swiftly through the water, while a howl of rage
went up from the baffled occupants of Morello's
boat.  But, having started his engines, Sam could
not resist the temptation to run astern and shake
a fist at the rascals.  In doing this he had lost his
balance, and before he could utter a cry, or even
make a sound, he was overboard.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Captain Nelsen, who was at
the wheel of the "Nomad," and supposed Sam
was still below at his engines, kept right on.
When he came to the surface Sam found that the
"Nomad" was some distance off and Morello's
boat close upon him.  The next instant hands
reached out for him from the craft and he was
dragged on board, and, on his shouting to attract
Nelsen's attention, was promptly knocked on the
head.
</p>

<p>
He came to in the cabin of the schooner and
here, as Sam said, he got a shock.  Bending over
him was the form of a man he knew only too well.
That of Elias Gooddale.
</p>

<p>
"But Elias Gooddale is dead in California!"
exclaimed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"True enough," rejoined Sam, "the real one
is.  But this Gooddale is a spurious one.  It is
time now that I should tell you what I have been
meaning to since we set out on our trip.  As you
know, I came from the South Sea Islands some
years ago.  I never told the reason&mdash;it was this:
When my father, Elias Gooddale, emigrated to
these islands from Australia I was only a little
fellow.
</p>

<p>
"But to return to the schooner," he broke off.
"This Gooddale, as he calls himself, instantly
recognized me and began a long rigmarole about
some sapphires.  It seems, to make a long story
short, that he and Morello whom he met years
ago in Mexico had come to some sort of agreement
to divide some sapphires.  I told them I
knew nothing about them."  (This was true.
While conversant with the main object of the trip,
Sam had not been told of the sapphire hoard.)  "I
also told Gooddale that I wished nothing to say
to him; that I knew him to be a scoundrel.  I
would have said more, but just then that fellow
Dayton struck in.
</p>

<p>
"'Head him up in a keg and chuck him overboard,'
he said.  'The fellow is in the way on
board and likely to prove a source of trouble if
we don't look out.'
</p>

<p>
"They seemed to hesitate a while and then
consulted together.  The upshot of it was that I was
to be placed in that barrel with some biscuit and
water.  Holes were pierced in the top and Morello
told me I ought to be lucky to get such a
chance for my life.
</p>

<p>
"Then they placed me in the thing, lowered me
overside, and set me adrift.  I was desperate at
first, as you may imagine.  But afterward I
cooled down and set to work trying to figure out
some way out of my scrape.  The better to keep
up my spirits, I started to sing.  A good thing I
did, too, or you'd have missed me sure."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are the son of the real Elias
Gooddale?" asked Nat wonderingly, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"I am, and I have in my chest the papers to
prove it.  But I never would take such steps but
for the black treachery of my uncle&mdash;my mother's
brother&mdash;for such is the relationship of the false
Elias Gooddale to me.  His right name is Jonas
Meecham.  Well, as I said, when we came out
here I was only a little fellow.  Father took up
land on Ohdahmi and soon had a flourishing
business on his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Then one day Jonas Meecham arrived.  From
what I have been able to gather, father had some
secret on his conscience which Jonas Meecham
also knew.  At any rate, from what I saw as I
grew older, I know that Meecham bled him for
money constantly.
</p>

<p>
"Not long after I made this discovery poor
mother died.  I was then in a terrible position
for a youngster, for father was moody and
melancholy and Jonas was cruel and crafty and
hated me.  One day, it was after a trading
schooner had called at the islands, father was
missing.  He left a letter for me, telling me that
he had left the island forever, leaving all he had
to Jonas and expressing the hope that he would
never prosper.
</p>

<p>
"He had gone to seek a new fortune in California,
he said.  Well, after he left, Meecham,
to avoid complications I suppose, assumed the
name of Elias Gooddale.  He was brutal and
cruel to me, and one night I stowed away on a
cocoanut schooner and escaped.  I drifted about the
islands for some time, learning much of sailoring
and boat building.  But all the time my goal was
California.  I longed to find my father.  In the
meantime, I assumed the name of Hinckley, for,
since my uncle took it, my own was hateful to me.
</p>

<p>
"By the merest chance, as you know, I entered
the service of Captain Akers.  In that way I
learned from you that you knew positively of the
death of my father."
</p>

<p>
"And also that he found the fortune for which
he was seeking, but found it too late to do him
any good," struck in Nat.  "Give me your hand,
Sam.  If things work out right, you will be a
wealthy man."
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;what?" stammered Sam, astonished at
the lad's enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"I mean what I say," went on Nat, who had
not previously told Sam any of the details of their
adventures.  "We have, by an extraordinary
coincidence, been holding in trust for you a
fortune."
</p>

<p>
"A fortune?  Where is it?" gasped Sam.
</p>

<p>
"In the hands of Morello, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stand by!" roared Captain Akers.  "Here she
comes!"
</p>

<p>
So engrossed had they all been in Sam's narrative
that they had not paid any attention to the
threatened storm.  But now "here she came," as
the captain put it, with a vengeance.
</p>

<p>
A white wall of water rolled toward the boat.
It did not seem as if she could live for an instant.
</p>

<p>
"Head her up into it!" roared Captain Akers
sturdily.
</p>

<p>
His order was obeyed and the boat, overloaded
as she was, rode the waves bravely, although
she shipped considerable water.  Following the
first billow, the waves, though high, were not so
menacing.  But it was without a doubt only a
question of time before the boat must be
overwhelmed.
</p>

<p>
"Look!" shouted Nat suddenly.  "There's a
small bay around that point yonder.  Pull for
that!"
</p>

<p>
"Right, my lad.  If we're not swamped before
we reach it, we can beach her there in safety,"
decided the captain.
</p>

<p>
The boat was headed for the bay.  On and on
she drove, the waves raising her heavenward one
minute and the next instant dropping her into a
dark abyss of their troughs.
</p>

<p>
"Hurray!  We're almost there!" shouted Nat
gleefully as they neared the beach.  But there is
many a slip 'twixt cup and lip.  Hardly had the
words left his lips before a mighty wave bore
down on the overladen boat.  Caught in the
avalanche of green water, she sank like a stone.  The
next instant her occupants were struggling in the
surf.
</p>

<p>
Nat struck out for shore, but before he reached
it his strength, already sapped by the adventures
of the night and morning, gave out altogether.
But just as the undertow caught him and he was
being dragged back into the boiling vortex of
surf, a strong hand seized him and dragged him
to safety.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Sam," choked out the half-drowned
boy, recognizing his rescuer.  "You saved my
life."
</p>

<p>
"And if all goes well, you have saved me a
fortune," retorted Sam briskly.  "Some time when
we have an opportunity I wish you would tell me
the full story of my father's death."
</p>

<p>
Nat promised.  He was glad to see, as he stood
on the beach, that all of the party had landed in
safely, although they presented a bedraggled,
miserable appearance.
</p>

<p>
Luckily Cal, like a seasoned mountaineer,
carried some matches in a waterproof case.  He
produced these and, collecting driftwood, they soon
had a roaring blaze going in the shelter of a cliff
and were standing about it drying themselves.
It was then that Sam heard from Nat's lips the
full narrative of the sapphire find and the
strange adventures that had followed thick and
fast.  Hardly had he concluded before, round the
point, there came driving through the storm a
craft which they all recognized with a shout as
the "Nettie Nelsen."
</p>

<p>
On she came, fleeing before the storm like some
frightened creature.
</p>

<p>
"My stars!" shouted Captain Akers, as he
gazed.  "If they don't put their helm up, they'll
be on the rocks in another minute!"
</p>

<p>
"That's right," cried Nat, "but look," he went
on, "no wonder they can't handle her.  Her
mainmast is gone."
</p>

<p>
"So it is, lad.  Gone by the board."
</p>

<p>
"She's driving straight for those rocks!" cried
Cal, indicating a line of low-lying rocks which
ran out seaward from the point.  The spray was
breaking over them in wind-driven clouds.
Through the whiteness their black points could
be seen sticking up like fangs.
</p>

<p>
In another moment the schooner was among
them.  A terrible, rasping, grinding sound
ensued as she pounded on the rocky surfaces.  A
sharp chill ran through the boys as they gazed.
In that sea, and in her position, it would have
been evident to the veriest landsman that she
could not live more than a short time.  Even as
they gazed the foremast snapped off short and
went overside with a terrific crash.  Worse still,
some figures, which had been clinging to it,
vanished with it.
</p>

<p>
"If we could only help them," breathed Nat.
"It is terrible to watch such a scene helplessly."
</p>

<p>
"Yet we can do nothing," said Captain Akers.
"But, look! it is the beginning of the end!"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke a big gap could be seen to open in
the side of the unfortunate schooner.  The waves
broke over her in clouds and her bowsprit snapped
off, dragged by the weight of the foremast, with
the report of a gun.
</p>

<p>
All at once the watchers saw two figures
emerge from below and appear on the stern.  It
was at once evident that they were struggling.
</p>

<p>
"It's Dayton and Morello!" exclaimed Nat.
</p>

<p>
"So it is," cried Joe.  "Look, Morello is
seizing something from Dayton and shoving it into
his pockets.  He's got on a life-belt&mdash;oh!"
</p>

<p>
The exclamation was called forth by something
that had just occurred.  The figure Nat had
recognized as Morello had been seen suddenly to
draw a pistol.  The next second there was a flash
and a puff of smoke.  No report could be heard
above the fury of the storm, but they saw Dayton
throw up his hands and topple backward.
</p>

<p>
As he did so Morello, without a backward
glance, leaped to the stern rail, and without an
instant's hesitation jumped overboard from the
fast-breaking craft.
</p>

<p>
"He'll be drowned!" cried Joe.
</p>

<p>
"No, he won't," rejoined Nat.  "I saw him put
on a life-belt before he jumped."
</p>

<p>
Breathlessly they watched Morello as he neared
the shore.  One minute he would vanish altogether,
but the next he reappeared, and steadily
forged ahead.  In the haste and desperation with
which he had left the schooner, he had not
noticed the party on shore.  But as he drew closer
he suddenly saw them.  Had they been a party of
ghosts he could not have been more panic-stricken.
With a loud cry that was instantly
choked by the water, he threw his arms above his
head.
</p>

<p>
As he did so he sank.  But the waves caught
him and rolled him toward the shore.
</p>

<p>
"We must get him out or he'll be killed," cried
Nat, as time and again the struggling man was
drawn back by the undertow.
</p>

<p>
"How can we?" gasped Cal.  "If only I had
a lariat here, I'd&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We can do better than that," said Nat hopefully.
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"Form a human chain.  Captain Akers, you are
the heaviest.  You will form the anchor.  Now
then you take hold of Cal and Cal will grip Ding-dong
and he in turn will hold Joe, who will grasp me."
</p>

<p>
Before they could remonstrate against his
daring plan, Nat had them all lined up under his
directions, and then, while Joe held him tightly, the
brave lad plunged into the surf.
</p>

<p>
As Morello came within reach he seized him,
only to find him instantly torn from his grasp.
But the next time the leader of the outlaws came
within reach Nat did better.  He caught and
gripped him tightly.
</p>

<p>
"Heave!" he shouted back to the others.
With a rush Nat and the man he had saved
were pulled out of the surf by the living chain
and landed high and dry on the beach.  Morello's
senses had left him and his cheeks were a dead
white under their swarthy hue.  He gasped like
a fish that has just been landed.
</p>

<p>
Nat knelt by him and began applying "first
aid" measures.  While doing so he noticed that
the man's body was extraordinarily lumpy.  The
next instant he discovered why.  Morello's
pockets were filled with the sapphires.  It was a
wonder he had not sunk like a stone when he jumped.
The cause of the fight between himself and
Dayton was explained now.  Doubtless the other had
tired to prevent his leader escaping with the loot.
</p>

<p>
Without compunction on the Motor Rangers'
parts, the outlaw leader's pockets were rifled.  Of
course, not all the stones were there, but the finest
lay exposed to view on the sand when the task
was done.  Sam Hinckley&mdash;or Sam Gooddale, as
we must call him now&mdash;looked on with eyes that
fairly bulged.
</p>

<p>
"And just to think," he exclaimed, "that my
poor dad found all that."
</p>

<p>
"It is tough to think that he found it too late
to make use of it," agreed Joe.
</p>

<p>
Just then Morello opened his eyes.  He sat up
with a start and a wild shout:
</p>

<p>
"Get the wheel over, you lubbers!  Head her
about, I say!  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off short and looked about him with
a terrible look of rage as he realized all at once
where he was and what had happened.  Suddenly
his eyes fell on the sapphires.  With a yell, he
dashed for them.  But Cal's strong hand jerked
him away.
</p>

<p>
"Go easy, colonel," he said.  "You've had a lot
of rope, but you've reached the end of it now.
And, moreover&mdash;&mdash;  Ah! you would&mdash;would
you!"
</p>

<p>
The colonel had drawn a knife, and, but for
Cal's quick blow on the wrist, which sent it
spinning into the spume, he would have plunged it
into the mountaineer.
</p>

<p>
"After that we'd better tie him," said Captain
Akers.  "Joe, my boy, will you cut some of those
creepers I see growing up yonder?  They'll make
nice bracelets and ankle ornaments for this gentleman."
</p>

<p>
Morello growled, more like a trapped wild beast
than a human being, and then, after being bound,
sank into apathy by the fire.  It was not till
some days later that they learned from him that
when the schooner had been dismasted some of
the crew had made off in a boat, among them
being the false Elias Gooddale.  It may be said
here that the boat was never heard of again, and
doubtless sunk in the hurricane, although it may
have reached some remote island.
</p>

<p>
What with shell fish on the rocks, and cocoanuts
and bananas inland, our castaways were in
no danger of starving.  But they passed a
restless night, nevertheless.  As for Morello, his
bound form sat huddled by the fire, gazing
unblinkingly&mdash;like a captured wild cat&mdash;into its
depths.  Of what was he thinking?  Of his
misspent life?  Perhaps.
</p>

<p>
At dawn, when the tempest had died out, Nat,
who was on watch, gave a great shout.  The
others instantly awakened and saw the most
glorious sight they could have thought of at that
instant.
</p>

<p>
The "Nomad" was moving swiftly into the bay.
Behind her came a "trig and trim" looking black
gunboat.  At her stern flew the tricolor of France.
As she anchored a puff of smoke rolled from her
side and a loud report went echoing against the
cliffs.  Evidently the gunboat's commander
meant to show the natives he meant business.  By
and by a boat was dropped and, manned with
sailors, left the gunboat's side.  It stopped at the
"Nomad" for an instant to take on the sturdy
form of Captain Nelsen.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later the adventurers were reunited.
Captain Nelsen found it hard to control
his emotion when he learned of the loss of his
schooner, of which no trace remained at daylight.
He did so manfully, however, and listened to the
boys' strange stories.  Another interested auditor
was Captain De Lesseps of the gunboat "Tricolor."
</p>

<p>
After missing Sam, Captain Nelsen had been
about to put back after him.  But the storm struck
him and he was blown seaward, despite the
powerful engines of the "Nomad."  Shortly before
dawn the French gunboat had seen his signals
of distress&mdash;blue Coston lights&mdash;and borne down
on him.  When the gale moderated the two
vessels had left in company for the island, the
captain in the meantime having told his story to
Captain De Lesseps.
</p>

<p>
No time was lost in sending landing parties of
marines after the savages and the leaders of the
raid were captured and doomed to exile on
another island.  The wounded man who had helped
the boys escape was also found and set at liberty.
This done, Morello, against whom the boys
lodged charges, was placed on board the "Tricolor,"
in irons in the brig, and taken to Nukahiva,
till it could be arranged to have him
extradited.  Among other charges, that of the
murder of Ed. Dayton, who was never seen again,
was placed against him.
</p>

<p>
Sam, in due time, proved his right to the
sapphires, which had led to such an eventful cruise
on blue water.  One of the first things noticeable
after Sam had acquired his wealth was that he
visited many shipyards, inquiring for the
smartest schooner obtainable.  The upshot of it was
that Captain Nelsen now has a new "Nettie Nelsen,"
fitted with auxiliary gasolene engines.  She
is the smartest craft of her size in the coast trade,
and the captain is on the road to fortune.

As for the Motor Rangers, the exigencies of
space compel us to bid them farewell, for the
time being, at this point.  But other adventures&mdash;in
a new field&mdash;are in store for them, to the full
as exciting as any through which they have yet
passed.  What these were and how our lads bore
themselves in the trying and often perilous
circumstances that lay ahead of them will all be told
in detail in the next volume of this series&mdash;"The
Motor Rangers' Cloud Cruiser."

BOY AVIATORS' SERIES
</p>

<p class="t3b">
By Captain Wilbur Lawton
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
The Boy Aviators in Nicaragua
</p>

<p class="t3">
Or, Leagued With Insurgents
</p>

<p>
The launching of this Twentieth Century series marks
the inauguration of a new era in boys' books&mdash;the
"wonders of modern science" epoch.  Frank and Harry
Chester, the BOY AVIATORS, are the heroes of this
exciting, red-blooded tale of adventure by air and land in
the turbulent Central American republic.  The two
brothers with their $10,000 prize aeroplane, the GOLDEN
EAGLE, rescue a chum from death in the clutches of the
Nicaraguans, discover a lost treasure valley of the
ancient Toltec race, and in so doing almost lose their own
lives in the Abyss of the White Serpents, and have many
other exciting experiences, including being blown far
out to sea in their air-skimmer in a tropical storm.  It
would be unfair to divulge the part that wireless plays
in rescuing them from their predicament.  In a brand
new field of fiction for boys the Chester brothers and
their aeroplane seem destined to fill a top-notch place.
These books are technically correct; wholesomely
thrilling and geared up to third speed.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
The Boy Aviators on Secret Service
</p>

<p class="t3">
Or, Working With Wireless
</p>

<p>
In this live-wire narrative of peril and adventure,
laid in the Everglades of Florida, the spunky Chester
Boys and their interesting chums, including Ben Stubbs,
the maroon, encounter exciting experiences on Uncle
Sam's service in a novel field.  One must read this
vivid, enthralling story of incident, hardship and pluck
to get an idea of the almost limitless possibilities of
the two greatest inventions of modern times&mdash;the
aeroplane and wireless telegraphy.  While gripping and
holding the reader's breathless attention from the
opening words to the finish, this swift-moving story is at
the same time instructive and uplifting.  As those
readers who have already made friends with Frank and
Harry Chester and their "bunch" know, there are few
difficulties, no matter how insurmountable they may
seem at first blush, that these up-to-date gritty youths
cannot overcome with flying colors.  A clean-cut, real
boys' book of high voltage.

<p class="t3b">
The Boy Aviators in Africa
</p>

<p class="t3">
Or, An Aerial Ivory Trail
</p>

<p>
In this absorbing book we meet, on a Continent made
famous by the American explorer Stanley, and ex-President
Roosevelt, our old friends, the Chester Boys and
their stalwart chums.  In Africa&mdash;the Dark Continent&mdash;the
author follows in exciting detail his young heroes,
their voyage in the first aeroplane to fly above the
mysterious forests and unexplored ranges of the mystic land.
In this book, too, for the first time, we entertain Luther
Barr, the old New York millionaire, who proved later
such an implacable enemy of the boys.  The story of his
defeated schemes, of the astonishing things the boys
discovered in the Mountains of the Moon, of the pathetic
fate of George Desmond, the emulator of Stanley, the
adventure of the Flying Men and the discovery of the
Arabian Ivory cache,&mdash;this is not the place to speak.  It
would be spoiling the zest of an exciting tale to reveal
the outcome of all these episodes here.  It may be said,
however, without "giving away" any of the thrilling
chapters of this narrative, that Captain Wilbur Lawton,
the author, is in it in his best vein, and from his personal
experiences in Africa has been able to supply a striking
background for the adventures of his young heroes.  As
one newspaper says of this book: "Here is adventure in
good measure, pressed down and running over."

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
The Boy Aviators Treasure Quest
</p>

<p class="t3">
Or, The Golden Galleon
</p>

<p>
Everybody is a boy once more when it comes to the
question of hidden treasure.  In this book, Captain Lawton
has set forth a hunt for gold that is concealed neither
under the sea nor beneath the earth, but is well hidden
for all that.  A garrulous old sailor, who holds the key
to the mystery of the Golden Galleon, plays a large
part in the development of the plot of this fascinating
narrative of treasure hunting in the region of the Gulf
Stream and the Sagasso Sea.  An aeroplane fitted with
efficient pontoons&mdash;enabling her to skim the water
successfully&mdash;has long been a dream of aviators.  The Chester
Boys seem to have solved the problem.  The Sagasso,
that strange drifting ocean within an ocean, holding ships
of a dozen nations and a score of ages, in its relentless
grip, has been the subject of many books of adventure
and mystery, but in none has the secret of the ever
shifting mass of treacherous currents been penetrated as
it has in the BOY AVIATORS TREASURE QUEST.
Luther Barr, whom it seemed the boys had shaken off,
is still on their trail, in this absorbing book and with a
dirigible balloon, essays to beat them out in their search
for the Golden Galleon.  Every boy, every man&mdash;and
woman and girl&mdash;who has ever felt the stirring summons
of adventure In their souls, had better get hold of this
book.  Once obtained, it will be read and re-read till
it falls to rags.

<p class="t3b">
The Boy Aviators in Record Flight
</p>

<p class="t3">
Or, The Rival Aeroplane
</p>

<p>
The Chester Boys in new field of endeavor&mdash;an attempt
to capture a newspaper prize for a trans-continental flight.
By the time these lines are read, exactly such an offer
will have been spread broadcast by one of the foremost
newspapers of the country.  In the Golden Eagle, the
boys, accompanied by a trail-blazing party in an
automobile, make the dash.  But they are not alone in their
aspirations.  Their rivals for the rich prize at stake try
in every way that they can to circumvent the lads and
gain the valuable trophy and monetary award.  In this
they stop short at nothing, and it takes all the wits and
resources of the Boy Aviators to defeat their devices.
Among the adventures encountered in their cross-country
flight, the boys fall in with a band of rollicking cow-boys&mdash;who
momentarily threaten serious trouble&mdash;are attacked
by Indians, strike the most remarkable town of the
desert&mdash;the "dry" town of "Gow Wells," encounter a
sandstorm which blows them into strange lands far to the
south of their course, and meet with several amusing
mishaps beside.  A thoroughly readable book.  The sort
to take out behind the barn on the sunny side of the
haystack, and, with a pocketful of juicy apples and your heels
kicking the air, pass happy hours with Captain Lawton's
young heroes.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
The Boy Aviators Polar Dash
</p>

<p class="t3">
Or, Facing Death in the Antarctic
</p>

<p>
If you were to hear that two boys, accompanying a South
Polar expedition in charge of the aeronautic department,
were to penetrate the Antarctic regions&mdash;hitherto only
attained by a few daring explorers&mdash;you would feel
interested, wouldn't you?  Well, in Captain Lawton's latest
book, concerning his Boy Aviators, you can not only read
absorbing adventure in the regions south of the eightieth
parallel, but absorb much useful information as well.
Captain Lawton introduces&mdash;besides the original characters
of the heroes&mdash;a new creation in the person of
Professor Simeon Sandburr, a patient seeker for polar
insects.  The professor's adventures in his quest are the
cause of much merriment, and lead once or twice to
serious predicaments.  In a volume so packed with incident
and peril from cover to cover&mdash;relieved with laughable
mishaps to the professor&mdash;it is difficult to single out any
one feature; still, a recent reader of it wrote the
publishers an enthusiastic letter the other day, saying: "The
episodes above the Great Barrier are thrilling, the attack
of the condors in Patagonia made me hold my breath,
the&mdash;but what's the use?  The Polar Dash, to my mind,
is an even more entrancing book than Captain Lawton's
previous efforts, and that's saying a good deal.  The
aviation features and their technical correctness are by no
means the least attractive features of this up-to-date
creditable volume."

MOLLY BROWN'S FRESHMAN DAYS
</p>

<p>
Would you like to admit to your
circle of friends the most charming
of college girls&mdash;the typical college
girl for whom we are always looking
but not always finding; the type
that contains so many delightful
characteristics, yet without
unpleasant perfection in any; the
natural, unaffected, sweet-tempered
girl, loved because she is lovable?
Then seek an introduction to Molly
Brown.  You will find the baggage-master, the cook, the
Professor of English Literature, and the College President
in the same company.
</p>

<p class="t3b">
MOLLY BROWN'S SOPHOMORE DAYS.
</p>

<p>
What is more delightful than a re-union of college girls
after the summer vacation?  Certainly nothing that
precedes it in their experience&mdash;at least, if all class-mates
are as happy together as the Wellington girls of this
story.  Among Molly's interesting friends of the second
year is a young Japanese girl, who ingratiates her "humbly"
self into everybody's affections speedily and permanently.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
MOLLY BROWN'S JUNIOR DAYS.
</p>

<p>
Financial stumbling blocks are not the only things that
hinder the ease and increase the strength of college girls.
Their troubles and their triumphs are their own, often
peculiar to their environment.  How Wellington students
meet the experiences outside the class-rooms is worth the
doing, the telling and the reading.

THE GIRL AVIATORS AND THE PHANTOM AIRSHIP.
</p>

<p>
Roy Prescott was fortunate in
having a sister so clever and
devoted to him and his interests that
they could share work and play
with mutual pleasure and to mutual
advantage.  This proved especially
true in relation to the manufacture
and manipulation of their
aeroplane, and Peggy won well
deserved fame for her skill and good
sense as an aviator.  There were
many stumbling-blocks in their terrestial path, but they
soared above them all to ultimate success.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE GIRL AVIATORS ON GOLDEN WINGS.
</p>

<p>
That there is a peculiar fascination about aviation that
wins and holds girl enthusiasts as well as boys is proved
by this tale.  On golden wings the girl aviators rose for
many an exciting flight, and met strange and unexpected
experiences.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE GIRL AVIATORS' SKY CRUISE.
</p>

<p>
To most girls a coaching or yachting trip is an
adventure.  How much more perilous an adventure a "sky
cruise" might be is suggested by the title and proved by
the story itself.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE GIRL AVIATORS' MOTOR BUTTERFLY.
</p>

<p>
The delicacy of flight suggested by the word "butterfly,"
the mechanical power implied by "motor," the ability to
control assured in the title "aviator," all combined with
the personality and enthusiasm of girls themselves, make
this story one for any girl or other reader "to go crazy
over."

THE MOTOR MAIDS' SCHOOL DAYS.
</p>

<p>
Billie Campbell was just the type
of a straightforward, athletic girl
to be successful as a practical
Motor Maid.  She took her car, as
she did her class-mates, to her
heart, and many a grand good time
did they have all together.  The
road over which she ran her
red machine had many an
unexpected turning,&mdash;now it led her
into peculiar danger; now into contact
with strange travelers; and again into experiences
by fire and water.  But, best of all, "The Comet" never
failed its brave girl owner.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE MOTOR MAIDS BY PALM AND PINE.
</p>

<p>
Wherever the Motor Maids went there were lively times,
for these were companionable girls who looked upon the
world as a vastly interesting place full of unique
adventures&mdash;and so, of course, they found them.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE MOTOR MAIDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.
</p>

<p>
It is always interesting to travel, and it is wonderfully
entertaining to see old scenes through fresh eyes.  It is
that privilege, therefore, that makes it worth while to join
the Motor Maids in their first 'cross-country run.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
THE MOTOR MAIDS BY ROSE, SHAMROCK AND HEATHER.
</p>

<p>
South and West had the Motor Maids motored, nor
could their education by travel have been more wisely
begun.  But now a speaking acquaintance with their own
country enriched their anticipation of an introduction to
the British Isles.  How they made their polite American
bow and how they were received on the other side is a
tale of interest and inspiration.

THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS AROUND THE WORLD.
</p>

<p>
Could Jules Verne have dreamed
of encircling the globe with a motor
cycle for emergencies he would have
deemed it an achievement greater
than any he describes in his account
of the amusing travels of Phileas
Fogg.  This, however, is the purpose
successfully carried out by the Motor
Cycle Chums, and the tale of their
mishaps, hindrances and delays is
one of intense interest, secret
amusement, and incidental information to
the reader.

<p class="t3b">
THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS OF THE NORTHWEST PATROL.
</p>

<p>
The Great Northwest is a section of vast possibilities
and in it the Motor Cycle Chums meet adventures even
more unusual and exciting than many of their experiences
on their tour around the world.  There is not a dull page
in this lively narrative of clever boys and their attendant
"Chinee."

<p class="t3b">
THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS IN THE GOLD FIELDS.
</p>

<p>
The gold fever which ran its rapid course through the
veins of the historic "forty-niners" recurs at certain
intervals, and seizes its victims with almost irresistible
power.  The search for gold is so fascinating to the
seekers that hardship, danger and failure are obstacles
that scarcely dampen their ardour.  How the Motor Cycle
Chums were caught by the lure of the gold and into what
difficulties and novel experiences they were led, makes a
tale of thrilling interest.

They have experiences "that never were on land or sea,"

Blest with natural curiosity,&mdash;sometimes

THE BOY INVENTORS' VANISHING GUN.
</p>

<p>
A thought, a belief, an experiment; discouragement,

danger, despair and persistence figure.  This merely
suggests the circumstances which draw the daring Boy

and which demonstrate the practical use of their

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
